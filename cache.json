          "description": "大家都知道我喜欢好的调查，那么让我们来看看云原生计算基金会（Cloud Native Computing Foundation，CNCF）2021年的年度调查。 他们询问了2302名受访者是如何使用Kubernetes以及其他更通用的云原生工具的。 报告的主要结论是：Kubernetes的使用已经成为主流，因为报告的副标题是2021年：“Kubernetes跨越鸿沟的一年”。\n \n​​今年的调查有很多主题，但本文仅介绍我最感兴趣的三个主题。\n \n成为主流\n当CNCF的调查以“Kubernetes跨越鸿沟的一年”为副标题时，就意味着“Kubernetes正在进入主流”。让我们来检查一下这个说法。首先：“鸿沟”？\n \n这与创新扩散理论（Diffusion of Innovations Theory）相关，杰弗里·摩尔（Geoffrey Moore）在其著作《跨越鸿沟》（Crossing the Chasm）中指出，软件市场的采用经历了五个阶段：创新者、早期采用者、早期大众、后期大众和落后者。各个群体对新的、难以使用的软件的容忍程度都是逐渐降低的。创新者会忍受一切，因为他们喜欢使用新技术，落后者甚至可能会对你的新软件不感兴趣。在有远见的人和早期大众之间有一条鸿沟，这是大多数软件公司无法跨越的。这就是为什么，对于一个供应商（现在也包括公有云）来说，对一小部分客户有效的方法不再适用于其他所有人。他们必须“扩展”他们的产品管理、工程、支持、销售和营销，以扩展到组织中，这些组织每天都有越来越多日常的、正常的、甚至是无聊的问题。因此，摩尔的模型是一个很好的模型，它解释了Kubernetes是否以及是何时成为主流的。\n \n让我们来算算看Kubernetes是否已经跨越了鸿沟。在摩尔模型中，每一组的表现呈现出了钟形曲线的形势（令人惊讶！），创新者占2.5%，早期采用者占13.5%，早期大众占34%，后期大众占34%，落后者（谢天谢地！）只占16%。为了跨越鸿沟，你需要让16%（2.5%+13.5%）的人使用你的软件。如果你在17%到50%（2.5%+13.5%+34%）范围内，你就进入了主流领域。\n点击查看原文>",
