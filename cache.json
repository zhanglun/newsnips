You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "muwoo: \n前言\n对于前端同学来说，我们会经常用到各种小工具，比如：图床、颜色拾取、二维码生成器、url 管理、文本比对、json 格式化。当然我们可以 chrome 收藏夹来管理各种在线的小工具，但作为一个有追求的前端，我们不仅仅要自己用的爽，也可以将一些好用的工具给团队用，提高团队的研发效率。\n所以基于以上诉求，市面上或者很多公司内部都会做一些满足自己团队需要的客户端工具，大多是基于 electron 来实现。但如果本篇文章只介绍如何通过 electron 来做一个工具集，那就小了，格局小了！ 要做就做大的，我们不仅仅为前端赋能，我们更需要为后端、测试、UI 、产品甚至老板提效赋能。所以一旦做大了，工具箱将会变得非常臃肿，体积也会越来越大。每次更新所有人都必须升级才能体验新功能。已于以上问题，我们需要设计一款可插拔式的设计方式，用到时才安装，用不到不需要进行安装使用。插件独立于工具箱之外单独发布。\n如果你对这样一款工具也感兴趣，可以继续阅读实现过程。不过可以直接上源码先：\nRubick 源码\n取名\n开篇第一步，按照我之前的套路都是先取好名字先占个坑，之前写了一本《从 0 开始可视化搭建》的小册，里面基于 dota 取了个 coco 的名字。这次我取名的是 rubick 即 拉比克。知道 rubick 技能的就能领会啥意思了，主要是可以随心所欲想用啥技能就用啥技能，可插拔。和我们的理念也非常一致：\n\n实现\n初始化项目\n这里我采用的是 electron-vue 来做的项目脚手架，直接按照官网介绍，开始 create 好一个 electron 项目：\n# 安装 vue-cli 和 脚手架样板代码\nnpm install -g vue-cli\nvue init simulatedgreg/electron-vue rubick\n\n# 安装依赖并运行你的程序\ncd rubic…",
