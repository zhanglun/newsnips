You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "近年来，Deepfake图像做得越来越逼真了。在某些情况下，人类甚至没法轻易看出这些图像与真实图像之间的区别。尽管Deepfake图像的检测仍然是业界面对的一大挑战，但由于这项技术的水平越来越高，检测它的动机也越来越充分，例如：如果Deepfake图像不仅是为了娱乐和技术展示用途，而被用于大规模欺诈行为该怎么办？\n\n今天，我们与密歇根州立大学（MSU）合作，展示了一种检测和归因（attributing）Deepfake图像的研究方法，这种方法的基础是对单张AI生成图像的生成模型的逆向工程。我们的方法将推动真实世界环境中的Deepfake图像检测和跟踪研究，现实中Deepfake图像本身通常是检测器唯一能用到的信息。\n\n\n为什么要逆向工程？\n\n当前讨论Deepfake图像的方法侧重于判断图像是真实的还是Deepfake（检测），或识别图像是否由训练期间看到的模型生成（基于“封闭集”分类的图像归因）。但是，要想应对Deepfake图像激增的趋势，需要更进一步的研究，并设法将图像归因（image attribution）扩展到训练中存在的有限模型集之外。重点在于超越封闭的图像归因方法限制，因为Deepfake图像可能是用在训练中没见过的生成模型来创建的。\n \n逆向工程是解决Deepfake图像问题的另一种方式，但它在机器学习中并不是一个新概念。之前关于逆向工程ML模型的研究是通过检查其输入/输出对来获得模型的，这种方法将模型本身视为一个黑匣子。另一种方法假设硬件信息（例如CPU和内存使用情况）在模型推理期间是可用的。这两种方法都依赖关于模型本身的先验知识，这限制了它们在现实世界中的实用性，因为这些信息通常是不可用的。\n点击查看原文>",
