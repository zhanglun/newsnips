          "description": "HubSpot 的数据基础设施团队，每天都要处理 2.5PB 以上的低延迟流量，他们亲眼目睹了 Locality 对于 HBase 的性能有多么重要。请继续阅读，以了解更多关于这些问题：什么是 Locality ，为什么如此重要，以及我们如何在不断增长的 HBase 集群中使保持 Locality 成为一个不成问题的问题。\n \nHubSpot 的一些最大的数据集存储在 HBase 中，这是一个开源的、分布式的、版本化的、非关系型的数据库，模仿谷歌的 BigTable。我们拥有将近 100 个生产 HBase 集群，包括亚马逊云科技两个区域的 7000 多个 RegionServer。这些集群每天能处理 2.5PB 以上的低延迟流量，由于亚马逊云科技的每个区域是由多个数据中心组成的，因此我们认为，Locality（译注：即局部性 、本地性，指将数据放在离需要者尽可能近的地方）是保持这些延迟的关键。\n \n什么是 Locality？\n \nHBase 数据存储在 HDFS 中，默认情况下，会有 3 种方式来复制你的数据。\n \n\n如果可能的话，第一个副本会在本地写入客户端（HBase RegionServer）。\n点击查看原文>",
