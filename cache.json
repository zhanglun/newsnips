          "description": "MeLU全称为Meta-Learned User Preference Estimator for Cold-Start Recommendation，旨在解决推荐中的冷启动问题，能够保证新用户只有少量行为的基础上训练出一个不过拟合并且效果不错的模型。除此之外MeLU还可以找到验证商品集，将这些验证商品集展示给新用户能帮助推荐系统更快速的识别出用户兴趣。\nMAML\n\n首先我们需要先介绍一下MeLU里面的核心算法：Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning，本文简称MAML。该算法的目的是给定一个新任务，我们能通过该任务下极少量的样本达到一个不错的模型效果。因为样本比较少因此模型的训练迭代次数也会很少。这种能力对于模型来说很难，因为样本少的情况下很容易过拟合，让模型学习出只适用于这几个样本的一些无用的知识。另一方面人类却很擅长这方面,我们总是能找出新领域和自己已经积累的知识的联系，比如人类有语言大师，同时掌握很多门语言。他们在掌握一两门语言的基础上，会利用自己学习语言的经验比其他人更快的掌握新的语言。你可以理解为这些语言大师其实学到了某种元知识，适用于所有语言，而不是只适用于某一种语言。这种元知识帮助他们更快的学习新的语言。用模型的语言描述一下就是：对于新任务，在元知识的基础上经过几步back propagation就能达到比较低的loss。\n \nMAML的伪代码如下。其实MAML就是在显式的建模上述描述的过程：让模型学习元知识，而不是只适用于某一个任务的知识。假设我们有T个任务，p(T)表示训练时从这些任务里面抽样的概率，实践中完全随机采样也可以当作一种概率分布。我们要学习的元知识就是θ。我们通过概率分布获得一些需要训练的任务。之后针对每个任务我们拿K个样本进行梯度下降，并拿这个梯度更新原始参数得到θ。之后把更新后的参数带入损失函数得到loss，这个loss代表了θ经过一步迭代之后的模型效果（这里也可以进行多步迭代）。这个loss越小，表示θ越有效，即能在极少迭代的情况下达到一个不错的模型精度。这里完全和我们上面描述的元知识匹配。并且这里的梯度方向是所有任务梯度的加和，得到的元知识也是适用于所有任务的。注意到θ是通过间接影响到最终的loss。\n\n\n\n实践中第6步和第8步用于计算梯度的样本是不相交的，第6步的样本用于减少具体任务的loss，叫做support set，同时这一步的参数更新称为local update。第8步用于验证经过几步迭代后的效果，叫做query set, 同时这一步的参数更新称为global update。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "近日，博睿数据正式推出了一款多源事件统一接入、海量告警降噪收敛、故障统一管理的新一代告警平台——OneAlert。该平台可以帮助企业在构建数字化运维体系过程中，降低运维成本、提升工作效率，为业务的稳定运行保驾护航。\n\n\n当前，随着企业数字化转型进程加速，企业的 IT 运行环境日趋复杂，尤其是随着信息化建设的不断深入，信息系统越来越多，各类系统越来越复杂，数据处理量也成倍的增长，极容易产生大面积事件的告警风暴。\n\n为了快速发现自身平台故障，需要使用多个监控平台满足不同场景的监控需求，但各个平台往往互相独立，经常需要在多个平台查看和处理告警，事前发现、事中处理、事后审计都很难统计所有告警信息，使相关人员工作难度加大，导致运维管理成本较高，工作效率低下，运维人员苦不堪言。\n\n博睿数据产品管理部高级总监孙丽在接受 InfoQ 等在内的少数几家媒体采访时表示，当前运维市场监控孤岛化现象非常严重，很多客户监控平台可能达到十几家，包括云厂商监控、容器监控、业务方监控，以及 APM、NPM、DM 厂商监控等等。未来，ITOM 的市场趋势就是统一。因此，统一事件告警平台 OneAlert 应运而生。\n数字化趋势下传统IT运维的挑战\n\n在数字化趋势下，传统的运维管理流程相关工具暴露了诸多问题。孙丽在接受采访时表示，当前主要存在以下三大问题：\n点击查看原文>",
