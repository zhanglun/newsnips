          "description": "ywisax: \n最近在调研新项目的启动框架，目标开发语言是 PHP ，调研了一些常用的框架和新框架：\nLaravel：生态成熟，脚手架什么特别多，启动成本低；\nThinkPHP：多年的偏见很难纠正，但是架不住熟练工多，需要考虑的；\nYii2：个人最喜欢的框架，但是更新节奏太慢了，3.0 估计还得等一两年；\nSymfony：现代 PHP 框架的基石，但是要熟练使用比较困难；\nHyperf：用的人不多，骂的人不少。但看代码感觉挺好的，特别是 AOP 那部分；\nSpiral：RoadRunner 法力加持，开发体验很不错；\nWebman：Workerman 作者最近在开发的一个应用框架，开发体验比 Spiral 好一点；\n综合考虑下来（让自己写得舒服点、短时间就自己在开发、可能自己维护个两三年），最终还是决定用 Symfony 了。\n值得一提的是，就上面几个调研的框架来看，fpm 下运行的情况下，Symfony 的响应速度是最快的。按照大众认识，Symfony 应该是最慢的才对。\n虽然 Symfony 很快，但是在 fpm 下依然达不到 golang 吹心中的互联网 CURD Boy 的最低水平，为此我琢磨了下使用 Workerman 来作为 HTTP Server ，从而达到一个更好的性能水平。\n实现路径很简单：\nWorkerman 实现一个标准的 PSR Request / Response HTTP Server;\nSymfony Application 需支持 PSR Request / Response;\n其中 Workerman 在最新版本的 HTTP 服务是已经支持 PSR 的了。\nSymfony 方面官方也有维护 symfony/psr-http-message-bridge 。\n基于社区资源，我搞了一个 Bundle ，地址是 https://github.com/tourze/workerman-server-bundle\n要体验的话，很简单：\n# symfony-cli 自行安装，大概率是要 FQ ，下面的命令最好也 FQ ，要不就自己改 composer 配置\nsymfony new --demo symfony0315 # 我目前只测试了 symfony5.4 ，其他版本的话自行解决\ncd symfony0315\ncomposer require tourze/workerman-server-bundle -vvv\nbin/console workerman:http start\n\n然后打开 http://127.0.0.1:8080/ 即可体验。在默认开启了 Web Profiler 的情况下，可以做到 10-20ms 的响应。创建配置文件 .env.local 来切换到 production 环境：\nAPP_ENV=prod\nKERNEL_CLASS='App\\Kernel'\nAPP_SECRET='$ecretf0rt3st'\nSYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER=999999\nPANTHER_APP_ENV=panther\nPANTHER_ERROR_SCREENSHOT_DIR=./var/error-screenshots\nDATABASE_URL=sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/data/database_test.sqlite\nMAILER_DSN=smtp://localhost\n\n重启服务，此时刷新可以看到基本上可以保证请求在 10ms 内了，达到 phper 最低水准。\n不会在 v2 贴图，图片就不放了。\n这个思路同样试用于其他类似的 PHP 框架，只要实现了 PSR 请求规范，都可以通过类似方式来改造。类似的注意点有：\n非 FPM 运行的 PHP 应用，没有 FPM 这种保姆来帮开发自动清理内存了，所以需要认真 review 代码，或者偷懒搞个 maxRequest 机制，处理数量到一定级别就自动退出这个进程（等 Workerman 自动再启动新进程）\nMySQL 、Redis 这种外部资源的连接，需要自己做保活；\n不要 die 、不要 exit ，多用 yii2-debug 、symfony web-profiler 这种工具，或者干脆点多 throw Exception ；\n加了 Workerman ，实际最大解决的是文件加载、和初始化对象的开销，如果业务代码很复杂的话，提升效果不明显的；",

          "description": "本文整理自华为云主任工程师莫春辉在 GMTC 全球大前端技术大会（深圳站）2021 的演讲《多技术栈及高低代码混合开发——华为云低代码平台架构探讨》。\n\n当前，华为云部门内部的前端技术栈并不统一，比如华为云官网的 Console 控制台使用 Angular 技术栈开发，其他内部 IT 系统使 Vue 技术栈开发。因此，华为云要建设一套低代码搭建平台，对内提效能要同时兼顾 Angular 和 Vue 两种技术栈，对外建生态则要同时支持 Vue 和 React 技术栈。\n\n另外，目前业界的低代码搭建平台大多局限于简单的应用开发，而华为云自身的业务逻辑中，既有需要用高代码开发的复杂页面，又存在一些简单页面。这些复杂页面，你很难完全通过可视化拖拽搭建出来，但对于简单的页面，又希望能够使用可视化拖拽快速生成。因此，支持高低代码混合开发的需求就摆在了我们的眼前。\n1. 华为云低代码平台建设背景与诉求\n华为云低代码平台的建设背景\n\n在 Gartner 的定义中，低代码平台被称为企业级低代码应用平台，是支持快速应用开发，使用陈述性、高级的编程抽象（如基于模型驱动和元数据编程语言）实现一站式应用部署、执行和管理的应用平台。不同于传统的应用平台，它支持用户界面、业务逻辑和数据服务的开发，并以牺牲跨平台的可移植性、应用开放性为代价来提高生产效率。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "背景介绍\n\n近十年间，伴随网络传输协议加密化的发展，流量分类的研究工作也在不断优化以适应现实场景下的流量分类需求。现有的工作已经意识到流量爆炸式增长和加密化不能再利用专家经验来手动构建明文字段构成的指纹库。\n \n一种基于明文报文包头域信息聚类和交叉关联的方法FlowPrint优化了对专家经验的依赖，但仍无法在全密化趋势的新型加密协议TLS 1.3中发挥作用。而另外两类典型的方法是依赖专家经验构造流序列统计特征和使用深度模型学习原始流序列的表征，他们优化了模型对明文的依赖性但是需要大量人工成本或准确标注的流序列。由于加密协议的全密化发展趋势和隐私保护相关法律的日益完善，获取准确标注的大规模流量不只是一个困难的工程问题，也面临社会管理和合法合规的挑战。因此，现有典型的三类方法的缺点是明显的。\n \n\n\n在自然语言处理和计算机视觉等领域，无监督的大规模预训练模型被提出并在相应领域取得里程碑式的发展。在自然语言处理中，BERT等工作提出即使没有标注，文字词语和句子之间也有关联关系能够学习并帮助构建这些自然语言的表征，并且对现有待解决的问题具有明显增益。但是如何在加密流量中引入，并且有效地进一步解决现有挑战是本篇文章重点解决的问题。\n \nHongYe He等人是已知近几年的首次尝试应用预训练架构到加密流量分类任务，但是研究者发现他们的尝试还有很多可优化的地方。网络流量本身是无语义的编码符号序列，但是网络传输过程受到实际内容（例如文本，图片，音频，视频等）的不同以及前后顺序的差异的影响，这导致直接将流序列视作“句子”进行生硬迁移的效果还不理想。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "前段时间，我们跟一位朋友打了赌，他赌如果 QCon 全球软件开发大会 策划 Rust 专题爆场，我们就要请他吃饭，我们答应了。但是过了几天一想，这个赌，怎么看都是我们“稳输”，因为 Rust 在近段时期确实是有一点点火。你们觉得呢？\n\n其实，我们关注到 Rust 语言，并不是因为它在近期被炒作得很厉害，而是看到了它背后的价值，为它抓心：这样一个好用的语言，如果因为生态发展不起来，就渐渐弱下去，那未免太可惜了。\n\n做 Rust 专题的过程中，我们做了一些用户调研，也看到了社区里的一些观点，在此想与你探讨一下。\n\n一是看到有同学吐槽说：“Rust 的使用者老是吹它有多好，但是好几年了，Rust 在国内并没有大规模使用，远远不如 Go，一直都没有发展起来。”于是这个同学预测，Rust 在国内很快就死掉了。\n\n这个推测有些惊悚，至少我们看到，Rust 在国内的发展曲线是在逐步向上的。据了解，国内最早的一个深耕 Rust 并落地的项目应该是 PingCAP，当时有不少想写 Rust 的同学想去这里工作。2018 年的时候，PingCAP 还邀请到 Rust 核心团队前成员 Brian Anderson 加入公司。再看看其他大厂，比如字节，也是早几年就对 Rust 有投入，2019年，他们的工程师曾在 QCon北京2019 分享过题为《Rust 跨平台客户端开发在字节跳动的实践》的演讲。另一个不显山露水的Rust使用者，华为，还是 Rust 基金会创始成员之一，内部有不少用 Rust 编写的产品，甚至早在 2017 年就与 Rust 结缘。\n点击查看原文>",
