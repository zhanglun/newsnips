          "description": "麻省理工学院计算机科学与人工智能实验室（CSAIL）的一个研究小组创建了一种新的量子计算编程语言，名为 Twist。Twist 的设计目标是让开发者更容易识别哪些数据是纠缠在一起的，从而创建错误更少、更容易调试的量子计算程序。\n\nTwist 项目地址：https://spectrum.ieee.org/quantum-programming-language-twist\n\nTwist 的基础在于识别量子纠缠。量子纠缠是一种物理现象，指的是量子计算机内两块数据的状态联结在一起。“当你操作处于纠缠状态的一块数据时也可能会影响另一块。你可以用这种特性来实现强大的量子算法，但它也让你写的程序很难直观推理，并容易引入微妙的错误。”上面这段话来自麻省理工学院 CSAIL 计算机科学博士生、Twist 论文的主要作者 Charles Yuan，这篇论文发表在《ACM 编程语言》杂志上。\n\nCharles Yuan 说：“Twist 提供了一些特性，让开发者可以确定哪些数据是纠缠的，哪些不是。”“在程序中加入关于纠缠的信息后，你就可以检查量子算法的实现是否正确。”\n\n该语言的特性之一是一个类型系统，使开发者能够指定他们程序中的哪些表达式和数据片断是纯粹的。据 Yuan 说，一个纯粹的数据片断是没有纠缠的，因此不存在可能由纠缠造成的错误和不直观的效果。Twist 还加入了纯度断言运算符来确认一个表达式不存在与任何其他数据的纠缠关系，与之搭配的还有静态分析和运行时检查，可以用来验证这些断言。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "世界格局在进入 21 世纪之后风云变幻，软件领域同样风起云涌。从硬件到软件，从单机到分布式，从孤岛到互联，程序员的创造力无比强大。但究其本质，软件工程和土木工程其实没有太大的区别，只不过一个是在码字母，一个是在码砖头。至于建筑的主体，设计缺陷，或者地基没打好，一样会垮塌，不管是楼塌了还是软件崩了，都可能成为整个世界都能感知到的大事件。\n\n本文作者刘星先后经历安全行业和大数据领域，2011 年加入淘宝，参与了当时全球最大的 Hadoop 集群的开发和运维，在阿里先后担任数据开发平台研发负责人、研发效能 Aone 研发负责人。本文中，他将从 2003 年淘宝网成立那年开始，回顾总结这些年来软件工程体系的主线技术，探讨变化和趋势，并从自己的视角给出一些观点和思考。  \n\n\n开发模型的演进\n\n选择何种模型对软件工程的工作开展至关重要，甚至对一段时期的技术特点都会产生本质性影响。所以，第一节必须从这里开始讲起。\n\n20 年前还是以单机软件为主的时代，以操作系统、办公套件、ERP 系统等为代表的大型合作类型软件工程，特点是研发周期长、进度缓慢，一旦分发到个人电脑上则不容易被召回替换。一旦软件比较优秀，满足了用户的基本需求，就很难推动用户再去升级，所以当年 Windows 升级换代替换任何一个成功版本都非常艰难。在这样的背景下，瀑布模型是最主流的一种开发模型，几乎垄断了所有大型软件的工程开展。瀑布模型的优点和缺点已经被总结的很好，本文不做展开，仅以我自身参与的瀑布模型工程体验来简单说一说。整个瀑布模型，就是大家经常提到的 V 字形，从需求到交付，位于 V 字最低端的是真正的编码过程，V 代表瀑布模型，简直是再恰当不过的字母，因为编码过程在这个模型中，真的就只占用那个端点的长度，其他时间都被各种讨论过程和文档占据。好像一个武林高手，在擂台上做了几个小时的准备工作，万事俱备后，突然出手用手指点了一下目标，然后就立即收手又搞了几个小时的收拾现场工作，大家都沉迷于这位高手出手前后的花式展示，而真正出招的那个瞬间却都被大家忽视了。据此诞生的 CMMI 认证，专门用来衡量高手出招前后姿势漂不漂亮，热身动作到不到位。\n\n受此影响，早期的互联网 Web 工程的开发也是遵从瀑布模型的组织形式来进行的，也许在执行上有所变形，但从系统架构上看，瀑布模型的痕迹非常明显。比如我们公司十八罗汉之一的一指主导的 WebX 框架（刚入职那会我有幸通过旺旺向还身在加拿大的一指请教过技术问题），通过配置和 Package 将工程切分的非常细致，让每一个工种都能找到自己应该按部就班的地方，负责写 SQL 的，负责写 HTML 的，负责写 JS 的，负责展示层模板的，负责事务层的，负责数据模型的等等，当页面上需要新增一个功能的时候，如果分工的每一层都需要一名专职程序员来做，那么很可能就要驱动 10 来位程序员进行修改，由于框架明确了这些人的工作范围和职责，所以这些人需要坐在一起讨论需求，通过文档来沟通对接细节，讨论单测和集测的展开，最终这些文档和沟通工作都完成后，武林高手们终于在一瞬间出手，页面上添加的那个活动页终于在最后一瞬间出现了，这时候，收到交付产物的运营抬起头一看日历，双十一大促已经是半个月前的事情了，忙活了大半年，大家什么都考虑到了，就是没考虑到耗时排期的漫长。\n点击查看原文>",
