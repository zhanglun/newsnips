You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "echo1937: \n我惊讶于我国那么早就已经引进了计算机，一直以为那时的计算机都在研究所里，因此搜了一下相关信息：\n1981 年，中央电视台、中国电子学会计算机普及委员会和中央电大联合举办计算机知识普及讲座，由谭浩强向全国讲授 BASIC 语言，当年收看人数超过 100 万人，次年起年年重播，收看人数超过 300 万人。（很多人都知道谭浩强的 Basic 语言和 C 语言的书籍，但我不知道还有这茬）\n1983 年大陆引进 Laser 310，由香港伟易达公司生产，主要是教育用途。据说当时大陆的电脑，低档的是 R1 （ PC8300 ）、中档的是 Laser310 、高档的就是传说中的 Apple IIe ；\n1984 年 2 月 16 日，在首届少年儿童计算机程序设计竞赛中获奖的丛霖和李劲，在上海展览中心为邓小平做了表演。邓小平当场表示：“计算机的普及要从娃娃做起”。同年，计算机课程首次进入上海的高中课堂，翌年成为高中阶段的必修课。（这让我很震撼，我记得浙江 2000 年左右才把计算机列为高中会考科目）\n1987 年 9 月，CANET （中国学术网）在北京计算机应用技术研究所内正式建成中国第一个国际互联网电子邮件节点，并于 9 月 14 日发出了中国第一封电子邮件：“Across the Great Wall we can reach every corner in the world.”\n1982 年 286，1985 年 386，1989 年 486，1993 年奔腾（ 586 ）。我有印象的第一台电脑是 AMD 的 K6-2，第一个知道的指令集是 3DNow!。虽然之前也见过几台计算机，但是都没有摸过用过，就是当个铁盒子远远地在边上看。\n那时候的电脑普遍很贵，2000 年，一台奔腾三电脑好像要 8000-10000，2021 年，一台中高端笔记本也就这个价格，对比 2000 年和 2021 年的房价，不敢想象；\n在 80 年代的第一次计算机普及高潮中，普及的对象主要是以下三种人；(1) 大学中非计算机专业的师生； (2) 部分在职科技人员和管理人员；(3) 大城市中的部分中学生。普及的内容偏重于计算机知识，尤其是计算机高级语言。通过十年的努力，己经在大学的所有专业普遍开设了计算机课程，结束了大学毕业生仍然属于“计算机盲”的历史。大家取得如下共识：计算机知识是当代知识分子知识结构中不可缺少的重要组成部分。\n我有点好奇的是，当下的哪个科技产品，相当于 80-90 年代的电脑，以后会深刻地改变这个世界的面貌呢？\nUp 主给 1983 年的电脑做了内存条，看看能不能运行",

How can I exploit multiple CPU/cores?》\nhttps://redis.io/topics/faq，说明了redis使用单线程的原因：\n\nCPU通常并不是Redis的瓶颈，因为Redis通常要么受内存限制，要么受网络限制。比如说，一般在Linux系统上运行的流水线Redis，每秒可以交付一百万个请求，如果你的应用程序主要使用O（N）或O（log（N））命令，几乎不会使用过多的CPU 。\n......\n不过从Redis 4.0开始，Redis就开始使用更多的线程了。目前使用多线程的场景（Redis 4.0），仅限于在后台删除对象，以及通过Redis modules实现的阻塞命令。在未来的版本中，计划是让Redis越来越线程化。\n点击查看原文>",
