          "description": "在MWC2022 巴塞罗那世界移动大会期间，以“释放联接潜力，加速数字经济发展”为主题的IPv6论坛举行。华为数据通信产品线副总裁赵志鹏发表了“IPv6+，数字化转型基石”的主题演讲，与产业各界共同展望IPv6+的未来。\n \n赵志鹏指出，数字化的快速发展对IP网络提出了新的需求，IP网络是数字化发展的基石。首先是海量物联的需求，预计到2030年，全球物联规模将达到百亿级别，支持海量接入将成为IP网络的重要基础能力；同时云时代的到来，更多企业选择多云的连接，对网络的实时性和灵活性带来了挑战；面向未来，不仅是办公业务上云，越来越多的生产业务也会向云端迁移，这对网络的确定性提出了更高的要求。“面对这些新需求，IPv6+在确定性、可编程性、智能运维等方面的创新，将进一步释放联接的价值。”\n \n据悉，IPv6是互联网协议第6版，是互联网工程任务组（IETF）设计的用于替代IPv4的下一代IP协议。由于IPv4地址不足的问题，已经严重制约了互联网的应用和发展，IPv6的使用解决网络地址资源数量的问题，“可以给地球上的每粒沙子都分配一个IP地址”。\n \n而IPv6+是IPv6的增强创新，是对基于IPv6的网络能力全面升级，在2020年8月ETSI（欧洲电信标准协会）发布的IPv6白皮书中，ETSI认为，IPv6+包括了基于IPv6的协议创新，并把IPv6和AI结合起来。以SRv6等协议创新为代表，结合网络分析、智能调优等网络智能创新技术，实现智能路径规划、业务快速部署、运维自动化、质量可视化、SLA保障、应用感知等。在2021年8月ETSI发布的Gap Analysis报告中，ETSI进一步总结道，IPv6+从超宽、广联接、确定性、低时延、自动化和安全六个维度全面提升IP网络能力。\n \n赵志鹏提到，从人人互联到万物互联，IPv6+已经在全球实现了100+的商用。那么，具体到千行百业的数字化转型过程中，IPv6+是如何发挥作用的？\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "当我与工程师交流时，我最常听到的一种抱怨是，他们觉得自己必须不断开发各种特性，而他们所使用的软件和工具却变得更加脆弱、不一致、令人沮丧，让他们越来越难完成自己的工作。\n \n作为工程师，我们会无奈地摇头，想知道为什么我们的业务伙伴（产品负责人、高级领导层、销售等等）没有看到那些对我们来说显而易见的问题，并且对他们不断将工程驱动的工作（例如技术债务、解决技术风险或增强系统以开辟新机遇）的优先级排在更多特性开发工作之后的做法感到沮丧。\n \n同时，我们的业务伙伴（与你共事且专注于业务的人们，如产品负责人、高级经理，甚至是客户）可能会觉得工程师总是在抱怨他们的软件质量和工作环境，并且总是想努力让技术变得更好。就像其他行当的工匠一样，他们希望手头的工具趁手又闪亮。但从业务伙伴的角度来看，业务上的诸多限制不允许我们花几个小时来给汽车打蜡和抛光，只为了让车看起来闪闪发光；有时我们要的只是到达目的地而已。\n \n我们可以尝试让业务伙伴像工程师一样思考，但重点在于要记得我们花了多少时间来学习自己的手艺——它是非常专业和复杂的。而且一般来说，在你真正构建了一段时间软件之前，你真的说不清楚什么才是可行的，什么又是不可行的。\n \n因此，也许更好的方法是让我们的工程师努力“用商务范儿说话”——用业务术语传达工程工作的重要性。\n点击查看原文>",
