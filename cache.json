You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "iyear: \nQ 群里讨论起来 slice 的传递，才发现有坑 = =\n看了网上的一些文章。slice 在传入函数后 append 会有坑\n下面是我的理解，不知道恰不恰当。\n一种情况是 cap 够，不扩容\nfunc main() {\n    sliceA := make([]int, 3, 4)\n    sliceA[0] = 0\n    sliceA[1] = 1\n    sliceA[2] = 2\n    fmt.Println(sliceA)\n    changeSlice(sliceA)\n    fmt.Println(sliceA)\n    fmt.Println(sliceA[:4])\n}\nfunc changeSlice(slicePass []int) {\n    slicePass = append(slicePass, 3)\n}\n\n//Output\n/*\n[0 1 2]\n[0 1 2]\n[0 1 2 3]\n*/\n\nslice 结构中的 len,cap 都是 int，无法在函数里面被改变。\n这种情况下指定了一个 len 为 3，cap 为 4 的 slice 。append 完后发现正常输出只会输出前三个数，验证了 len 并没有被改变。而当强制输出第四项时又发现 3 是存在的。\n例如截取数组等操作都是这种情况。\n也就是说这种情况下 append 对原数组生效，只是由于 len 没有改变而无法呈现出 append 的项。\n还有种情况是 cap 不够，slice 扩容\nslice 扩容会把扩容后的数组指向新内存，直接与原数组无关了，append 的项也不存在于原数组\n大概代码长这样\nfunc main() {\n    sliceA := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    fmt.Println(sliceA)\n    fmt.Printf(\"%d %p main\\n\", len(sliceA),sliceA)\n    changeSliceA(sliceA)\n    fmt.Println(sliceA)\n}\nfunc changeSliceA(slicePass []int) {\n    slicePass = append(slicePass, 6)\n    fmt.Printf(\"%d %p pass\\n\", len(slicePass),slicePass)\n}\n\n// Output\n/*\n[1 2 3 4 5]\n5 0xc00000c690 main\n6 0xc000016550 pass\n[1 2 3 4 5]\n*/\n\n\n所以是\ngo 中的 slice 在函数中被 append 时数据呈现不变分为两种情况。\n一种是 len 未被改变，由传值导致；\n一种是指针发生改变，由 slice 的内部扩容实现导致？\n这样理解有没有问题？",

          "description": "今天将分享的内容分为以下4个方面：\n\n一、缘起\n\n二、介绍多样的容器化技术\n\n三、Redis介绍\n\n四、Redis容器化方案的对比\n\n一、缘起\n首先我们先聊一下为什么今天我会分享这个主题。我和朋友一起组织了一个 Redis技术交流群，到现在已经经营了6年左右的时间，其中某一天在群里有一个小伙伴就抛出来一个问题：\n\n\n\n他问大家线上的Redis有没有使用Docker安装？Docker使用Host的网络模式、磁盘使用本地挂载模式这种方案怎么样？这里的话我们暂时先不说这个方案如何，因为在今天的分享之后，我相信大家对于这个方案应该会有一个更清晰的认识和评价。\n二、介绍多样的容器化技术\n1、chroot和jails\n在容器化技术方面，其实历史很久远了。虽然我们现在用的容器化技术，或者说 k8s，还有云原生的概念是近几年才火起来的，但是实际上就容器化技术的发展来说，其实是很早的了。比如说最早的时候来自chroot，chroot大家可能都用过，或者都有了解过，在1979年的时候它是来自Unix，它主要的功能是可以修改进程和子进程的/。\n\n通过使用chroot达到什么样效果呢？使用chroot加某一个目录，然后再启动一个进程，那么这个进程自己所看到的 / ,就是我们平时所说的 / 目录，这个 / 就会是我们刚才指定的文件夹，或者说刚才指定的路径。这样子的话可以有效的保护我们操作系统上面的一些文件，或者说权限和安全相关的东西。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "近年来，深度学习技术在诸多领域大放异彩，因此广受学术界和工业界的青睐。随着深度学习的发展，神经网络结构变得越来越复杂。复杂的模型固然具有更好的性能，但是高额的存储空间与计算资源消耗使其难以有效地应用在各硬件平台上。因此深度学习模型在端上部署和加速成为了学术界和工业界都重点关注的研究领域。\n \n一方面，有许多深度学习框架可以让开发者和研究者用于设计模型，每个框架具备各自独特的网络结构定义和模型保存格式。AI工程师和研究者希望自己的模型能够在不同的框架之间转换，但框架之间的差距阻碍了模型之间的交互操作。另一方面，由于深度学习模型庞大的参数量，直接在边缘端部署模型会产生较高的时延。\n \n百度EasyEdge端与边缘AI服务平台可以很好地解决上述问题。EasyEdge可以支持多种主流深度学习框架的模型输入，提供了方便的部署功能，针对业内各类主流芯片与操作系统进行了适配，省去了繁杂的代码过程，可以轻松将模型部署到端设备上。EasyEdge在集成了多种加速技术的同时对外提供多个等级的加速服务，以平衡模型推理时间和精度，一方面可以最大限度的减小模型在端上部署的延时，另一方面可以匹配更广泛的使用场景。\n \nEasyEdge支持多种不同类型深度学习模型的部署，包括常见的模型类型包括图像分类、检测、分割以及部分人脸检测、姿态估计。目前EasyEdge支持的经典网络种类超过60种以及多种自定义的网络类型。\n \n同时EasyEdge支持接入多种深度学习框架，包括飞桨PaddlePaddle、Pytorch、Tensorflow、MxNet等。为了更方便的实现部署，目前EasyEdge支持部分深度学习框架模型的互转换，如图1所示。例如用户想要在Intel的CPU上使用OpenVINO部署一个Pytorch模型，EasyEdge可以实现经过多次模型转换，将torch模型格式转换成OpenVINO IR格式，最后基于OpenVINO部署框架完成模型部署。\n点击查看原文>",
