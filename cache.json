SolidJS 是啥？\n我们都知道 SolidJS ，如果不知道，那你为啥要看这篇文章 (￣▽￣)\"\n我们都知道 SolidJS ，这是它的文档： https://www.solidjs.com/\n简单来说，SolidJS 就是真正 \"react\" 版的 React ，完全按需更新（哪里不懂点哪里），哪里数据变化更新哪里。\n比如一个组件：\nfunction App() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);\n  return <div>{value}</div>;\n}\n\nReact 是把 App 整个函数死去活来的调用（即 re-render ），而 SolidJS 则只更新 value 那一小块。\n当然，SolidJS 中是这么写的：\nfunction App() {\n  const [value, setValue] = createSignal(0);\n  return <div>{value()}</div>;\n}\n\n在 SolidJS 中， App 只在初始化时被调用一次，之后就不再执行。\n所以 SolidJS 里的 JSX 相当于 \"静态模板\"，只用来描述 UI 而不会再次调用，更没有 diff 。\n也就是说，随便在 App 里执行函数，随便在 JSX 里执行函数，都只触发一次。\n2. 先声明一下\n如何把 React 变为 SolidJS ？\n当然不是把 solid-js 重命名 react，也不是手动操作 DOM 脱离 React 的逻辑去更新。\n这里必须声明一下：\n以下实现，完全是基于 React 的 API 做的，而不是用 DOM API 或 jQuery 来 hack 实现的，那样的话就失去了意义。\n3. 如何实现呢？\n1. 怎么只更新 value() 一小块？\n这里是实现思…",
