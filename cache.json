          "description": "sevdot: \n这里分享每周的计划和完成情况，周五发布。\n话题\n本周的话题是程序员辞职回家养猪是否可行？\n前两天表妹夫约我回去养猪，如果是以前，我肯定不会理睬，开玩笑，我一个本科计算专业毕业的软件开发工程师，你让我去养猪？这不闹吗？\n事实上我并没有马上回绝他，我还很认真的思考过，并且媳妇商量过，真有马上辞职去养猪的冲动。出现这种前后落差有两个原因，第一是我五一去了一个农家果园玩了一趟，那里的风景很漂亮，那种生活看上去也很惬意；第二个是我们公司又降工资了，现在的工资已经不足以我们一家子在昆明生活了，只能另谋他路。\n可以重新找一份开发工作，但是受疫情影响，很多公司都在裁员，昆明这种三线城市的开发岗位本来就少，再加上我本身技术也就那样，很难找到符合自己预期工资的工作。\n你可能会说，还不是你菜，确实你说得对，这归功于前两年过得太舒服了，没有主动积极去更新自己的编程技能。\n另外我也再想，或许可以换一种活法，养猪也不是不可以。但是，冷静想想，养猪风险多高啊！也不确定自己能不能吃得了养猪的苦，而且如果回农村了，小孩子的教育怎么办？农村的医疗条件也没有城市的好。\n是大胆一点，跨出这一步，开启人生新篇章？还是保守一点，老老实实写代码，不断学习，不断提升自己，一直卷下去？还是说走其它的路？\n回顾\n暂时得不到结论的事情就先放一放，让我们一起来回顾本周所做的事情吧！本周除了完成公司安排的开发任务之外，业余时间我做了两件值得记录的事情：\n重构博客发布上线。\n分享博客。\n重构博客发布上线\n上周我完成了重构个人博客的全部开发工作，我迫不及待的想要将它发布上线，于是在周日，我花费了一整天的时间将博客整理部署上线，博客上线后我根据反馈，做了一些调整，还改了一些 Bug 。\n尽管这是一个很小的项目，但是在发布上线的时候依然很激动，做程序开发这些年，每次项目上线我都很激动，经常性的是晚上发布上线。记忆最深的是在老家远程办公，干到凌晨 4 点才发布上线，项目上线后我在群里面跟大家说，“我准备烧水杀猪了”，他们都以为我是开玩笑的，其实是真的，因为要给女儿办满月酒。\n猪整理干净后已经天亮了，本想睡一会，接到村里面要修路的通知，要求每家必须出一个人，我就接着去修路了，一直修改到下午 4 点才收工，午饭也随便对付一口。干到快要收工的时候，我真的很难提上力气，一起干活的堂嫂问我，“你怎么一点力气都没有啊，干活还不女的，是不是在城里闲惯了”，我笑了笑说，“锄头不好使，我去拉车吧”。\n还有许多值得回忆的上线经历，改天再聊吧。\n分享博客\n博客上线后我想得到一些反馈，所以我决定将我的博客分享出去，我分别在 V2EX 、learnku 、简书、csdn 这几个平台发布帖子分享我的个人博客。\n首先是在 learnku 上发布帖子，原因是我的个人博客是使用 Laravel 和 Bulma 开发的，并且是免费开源的，而 learnku 是非常活跃的 Laravel 社区，在 learnku 我得到了一些反馈，也给我的博客来了许多流量。\n接着我在 V2EX 上发贴分享我的个人博客，v2ex 是非常活跃的创意工作者社区，许多人在那里分享创造，于是我也在 V2EX 分享我创造的个人博客，同样，我也得到了一些支持和反馈，还得到一些不错的建议。\n最后我还分别在 csdn 和简书上发布帖子，遗憾的是我没有得到任何的反馈，之前在简书上发布过一些帖子，还获得了 2 千多人的关注，但是当我发布帖子分享博客的时候几乎没有人看。\n总得来看，v2ex 和 learnku 是非常活跃的，给我的个人博客带来了许多流量，在周四的时候流量达到了顶峰，400 的独立 IP 和  1700 的 pv 。\n实际上我除了想获得反馈外，还想获得一些转换，比如说增加微信公众号的关注量，可惜未获得任何关注量。可能是我写的博客文章质量不高的原因吧，毕竟我只是一个菜鸡，这也说明我需要输出更多高质量的文章内容。\n图片\n\n这是刚才趁我媳妇不注意偷拍的，她正在学着做手工，她说：“还是学着做点手工补贴家用吧！不然你的工资不够用了”，确实，至从降工资以来，家里面的经济就特别紧张。\n计划\n接着开始下一个业余项目，目前我有好几个想法，暂时还没有确定，明天或者后天我将宣布我的下一个业余项目，让我们一起期待一下吧。\n订阅\n这个周刊每周五发布，同步更新在个人博客和微信公众号。\n微信搜索\"sevdot\"或者扫描二维码，即可订阅。",

          "description": "近日，英伟达（NVIDIA）宣布，将 Linux GPU 内核模块作为开放源代码发布。早在几天前，NVIDIA 开始在 GitHub 上陆续公开相关代码，目前该项目已经收获 7.7k star，众多网友对本次开源纷纷表示难以置信。\n英伟达开源 GPU 内核模块代码\n\n本次开源无疑可以帮助改善英伟达 GPU 在 Linux 环境下的体验，与操作系统的紧密集成是帮助开发人员开展调试、集成和贡献回馈的重要一步。这些模块的开源还使得驱动程序在 Linux 发行版供应商手中更加易用。英伟达也改进了开箱即用体验，让用户轻松对英伟达 GPU 驱动程序进行签署与分发。现在，Canonical 和 SUSE 可以即刻将开放内核模块与 Ubuntu 及 SUSE Linux Enterprise Distributions 共同打包。\n\n\n\n开发者可以跟进代码路径，查看内核事件调度如何与工作负载进行交互，从而快速开展根源性调试。此外，企业软件开发者现可将驱动程序无缝集成至项目配置的定制化 Linux 内核当中。此番开源举措将帮助英伟达充分吸纳来自 Linux 最终用户社区的意见和评论，进而提升 GPU 驱动程序的质量和安全性。\n每次发布新驱动，英伟达都会在 NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules 页面上发布源代码快照。社区提交的补丁一旦经过审核批准，即可被集成到后续驱动程序版本当中。\n点击查看原文>",
