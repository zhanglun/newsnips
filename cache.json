          "description": "chloerei: \nV2EX 的网友大家好，我想推荐一个面向 Geek 的写作空间：GeekNote.net 。\n为什么创建 GeekNote\n自从学会网上冲浪以来，我就保持着写博客的习惯。发布方式从早期的博客平台，到自建博客，再到静态博客。随着博客的定制程度越来越高，文章却越来越少。维护静态站就像维护一个软件项目，这让我写作欲望越来越低。有一天我发现，真正应该做的不是折腾各种工具，而是多写一些文章。\n于是我又想找一个博客平台，只要满足一些简单的写作和发布需求就行。但是我发现竟然找不到让我满意的平台：国内的博客平台要不倒闭了，要不设计停留在十年前，让我没有使用欲望。国外的博客平台有一些设计得很好，但是国内不能访问。\n最终，我决定自己开发一个，这就是 GeekNote 。\nGeekNote 的特色\n极简的编辑器\nGeekNote 有一个极简的 Markdown 编辑器，没有工具栏，没有同步预览，只有最底限度的语法提示（例如标题加粗）。这是有意设计的，因为写作是与自己内心的交流，这个过程其他干扰都是不必要的。在一些编辑器中，这被称为 zen mode 。\n\nGeekNote 的 Markdown 语法跟 GitHub 保持一致（使用同一个库），可以使用代码库和表格等语法。\n编辑器有自动保存和历史版本管理，能避免操作不慎丢失内容。\n注重阅读体验\nGeekNote 的文章页面设计是以内容为中心，排除不必要的干扰，不像一些网站总有正文以外的内容漂浮在侧边或者底部，影响阅读。\n\n阅读页面适配了移动端，不会弹出安装移动应用的提示（没有移动应用😜）。对搜索引擎和社交软件友好，不会把内容锁定在平台内部。\n合集功能\n对于一些大型的话题，一篇文章是不够的，在这里可以分开几篇文章，然后添加到一个合集。\n\n合集的文章可以自定义排序，合集内的文章会添加“上一页”“下一页”的链接。\n总结\n以上就是 GeekNote 的介绍。博客并不是什么新事物，功能上并没有什么值得一提的地方，更多的是我的一些偏好，如何做减法。\n这个网站已经上线了半年多，经过不断优化，感觉可以推荐给大家用了。如果你想找一个不折腾的写作空间，不妨试一下 GeekNote.net 。",

          "description": "随着移动互联网和云计算技术的迅猛发展，越来越多的数据在云环境下进行存储、共享和计算，云环境下的数据安全与隐私保护也逐渐成为学术界以及工业界关注的热点问题。目前阶段，隐私保护技术主要基于密码算法及协议（如安全多方计算、同态加密等）完成场景落地，其优点主要在于具有较高的安全性和可靠性，然而，由于这些算法或协议的实现依赖于大量复杂计算（如乘法循环群上的乘法、指数运算，Pairing运算，格上的数学运算等），因此存在较大的性能瓶颈，难以在实际场景中大规模应用。\n\n作为基于密码学的隐私保护技术的一种替代方案，可信执行环境（Trusted execution environment，TEE）基于硬件安全的CPU实现了基于内存隔离的安全计算，可在保证计算效率的前提下完成隐私保护的计算。\n\n本文将阐释梳理TEE的概念定义及发展脉络，剖析TEE与基于密码学的隐私保护技术的对比及其在联邦学习中的应用，最后介绍TEE的现有框架和相关应用。\nTEE定义与发展脉络\n概念及辨析：TEE与REE\n\nTEE是一种具有运算和储存功能，能提供安全性和完整性保护的独立处理环境。其基本思想是：在硬件中为敏感数据单独分配一块隔离的内存，所有敏感数据的计算均在这块内存中进行，并且除了经过授权的接口外，硬件中的其他部分不能访问这块隔离的内存中的信息。以此来实现敏感数据的隐私计算。\n\n富执行环境(Rich Execution Environment，REE)指的是操作系统运行时的环境中，可以运行如Android、IOS等通用的OS（Opreating System）。REE是一个容易受到攻击的开放环境，如敏感数据的窃取、移动支付盗用等等。而TEE是中央处理器上的一个安全区域，能够保证敏感数据在隔离和可信的环境内被处理，从而免受来自REE中的软件攻击。此外，与其他的安全执行环境相比，TEE可以端到端地保护TA(Trusted Application)的完整性和机密性，能够提供更强的处理能力和更大的内存空间。在下图这一典型的可信执行环境架构中，TEE内部为REE中的软件提供了接口，使得REE中的软件可以调用TEE对数据进行处理，但不会泄露敏感数据。\n点击查看原文>",
