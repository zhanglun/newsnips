          "description": "6月30日，微软旗下代码托管平台 GitHub 推出了名为“ Copilot ”的 AI 编程辅助工具。但刚发布不久，这款工具便陷入了争议之中。\n \n基于数十亿行开源代码训练\n \n根据官方介绍，GitHub Copilot 工具由 OpenAI 开发的全新 AI 系统 OpenAI Codex 提供支持。Codex 基于 GPT-3 自然语言处理 (NLP) 模型演化而来，基于开源代码和自然语言进行了训练，可以理解编程语言和人类语言，并独立生成各种形式的文本。\n \n\n\n\n \n该公司声称 Copilot “在代码生成方面比GPT-3能力强得多”。Copilot 利用了上传到GitHub及其他网站的数十亿行公开代码。基于庞大的代码库，Copilot 被引入集成开发环境（IDE）后，可以对完整代码进行遍历，并向程序员给出基于人工智能的分析建议，程序员可以接受或拒绝。GitHub不保证生成的代码可以工作，因为Copilot 不会去测试代码。\n点击查看原文>",
