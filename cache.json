          "description": "随着越来越多的数据涌向企业，通过云服务厂商将数据上云已经成为大多数企业的共识。数据为王的时代，企业需要告别传统上云，让企业应用实现云原生。\n\n\n数据上云能给企业带来诸多便利。例如，加快企业配置和部署工作，更好地管理资源；云储存带来的高扩展性，可以使得企业获得更多的资源配置等等；然而，企业数字化进程进入到一个新阶段，企业上云不再是传统方式那样把业务放入容器和 VM 中，更应该让业务“生于云、长于云”。企业云化从“ON Cloud”走向“IN Cloud”， 新生能力与既有能力有机协同、立而不破，实现资源高效、应用敏捷、业务智能、安全可信，助其成为“新云原生企业”。\n\n云原生，即云上内生的云能力，基于统一的架构和云原生基础设施，实现多云协同、混合云解决方案、边云协同等能力。云原生时代下，企业应用数据的方式发生了根本性变化，即基于统一云基础设施的云原生数据库、大数据解决方案，将成为企业数字化转型的数据底座。\n\n本篇文章将聚焦于不同的业务场景，探讨企业通过云原生能力进行数据上云时，面临的潜在问题以及相应的破解之法，以期帮助企业顺利实现数字化转型升级。\n数据要上云，企业会有哪些顾虑？\n\n正如上述所言，数据上云、云原生已是大趋势，通过上云，企业也能获得很多好处。目前，企业大多会依靠云服务厂商提供的数据库以及大数据平台，完成云原生改造。但是在数据存储和使用中，还存在着一些风险，同时，这些风险也是企业上云过程中非常关注的问题。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "2021年，是金税四期工程建设的开启之年。作为国家信息系统重点工程之一，金税工程的目标是将一般纳税人认定、发票领购、纳税申报、税款缴纳全过程实现网络化运行，加强增值税征收管理。自1994年正式实施以来，金税工程经历了一期、二期、三期建设阶段，实现了增值税征收管理从人工核查到电子防伪，再到联网打通。\n\n如今，全国范围内税收征管系统再次迎来一次全面升级。与金税三期相比，四期的目标是构建智慧税务，实现“税费”全业务、全流程、全数据的“云化”打通。其主要建设内容包括了全面电子化，企业发票流、资金流、合同流、货物流四流合一，企业员工薪资社保数据比对，以及对企业收入、成本、利润、库存等闭环式数据的全面了解。并且，除了税务方面，金税四期还会纳入“非税”业务，实现对企业业务的全方位监控。\n\n一言蔽之，金税四期的上线，将使税务数据信息更透明、监管更全面、更精准，加速“以数治税”时期的到来。对于税务机关而言，由数据驱动的税务征管将成为“刚需”，数据管理的压力也随之升级。\n\n首先，要构建起税务总局和省局两级数据管理体系，实施上下一体化的数据调度和统一的标准规范体系；其二，要在机关内部建立起系统化的数据应用体系，实现多层级的数据管理能力提升；其三，要强化数据安全管理，以资产化建设为目标，加强大数据分析应用信息安全保障体系的建设；其四，要基于统一的数据平台，实现数据高效共享。\n\n事实上，这样的数据管理压力在各个行业的数字化转型过程中普遍存在。不知道内部拥有什么数据、从哪获取数据、如何处理数据和使用数据等各种问题正在成为各行业推进数字化的“堵点”。而面对这一系列挑战，四川省税务局历时两年，对遍布于70余个系统的历史数据和实时数据进行了重新梳理和汇聚；又历时近一年建成了数据知识体系——为实现“以数治税”和后续的智慧税务场景落地打下了关键基础。\n点击查看原文>",
