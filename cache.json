          "description": "重新认识可观测性\n\n管理学大师彼得德鲁克有一句话：“如果你无法衡量它，你就无法管理它”。在企业中，无论是管理人，还是管理事，抑或是管理系统，首先都需要衡量。衡量的过程其实是搜集信息的过程，有了足够的信息才能做出正确的判断，有了正确的判断才能做出有效的管理和行动方案。\n\n下面我用一个简单模型来说明我对可观测性的理解：\n\n\n\n可观测性描述的就是“观测-判断-优化-再观测”这个闭环的连续性、高效性。如果只有观测而无法基于观测做出判断，则不能称其具备可观测性。如果只有经验判断而没有数据支撑，也不能称其具备可观测性，这样会导致组织高度依赖个人能力而带来管理风险。如果优化之后无法反馈到观测上，或者因优化引入新的技术而导致无法观测，则其可观测性不可持续。如果在观测、判断、优化的闭环中需要付出很高的成本和承担很大风险，则其可观测性的价值为负。\n\n所以，当我们在谈可观测性的时候，其实更多考虑的是观测者、管理者的感受，也就是说在我们遇到问题的时候，能否轻而易举地在观测平台找到答案，没有阻力也没有困惑，这就是可观测性。随着企业的发展，组织架构（角色、观测者）和管理对象（系统、被观测者）都会随之发展变化，当使用了一堆传统的观测工具，却仍然无法满足观测者、管理者新的需求的时候，我们不禁要问：“可观测性何在？”。\n“可观测”不等于“可观测性”\n\n下面，我们来看一下我们习以为常的观测方式。\n\n\n\n点击查看原文>",
