          "description": "conge: \n原文地址 https://conge.github.io/2022/04/27/sitting/\n想象\n在上一篇讲冥想的文章《冥想与呼吸》中，我提到了“端坐”是初学者最先进行的练习。\n初学者大可以不关注呼吸。\n我认为初学者最先进行的冥想练习，就是端坐\n这次，就来说说端坐。\n提到端坐，或者冥想的端坐，不知道你的头脑里会出现怎样的画面？\n来现在想象一下吧。\n好。\n我敢打赌，是个人里面有 9 个人想象的是这样的……\n一个人盘腿席地而坐，双手多半还结个手印。\n没错，这是许多自身冥想练习者采用的姿势。但是，如果你是初学者，你应该先忘记它。那是你的目标，但不该是你的起点。\n当然，你可以试试，你是否能用那个姿势舒舒服服的坐上 5 分钟。如果可以，那恭喜你，你是先天条件好的练习者，不必在坐姿练习上花特别多的功夫。\n但当你是初学者，你不必在意盘腿，就可以先练习端坐冥想了。\n坐姿\n初学冥想，重要的是沉静下来，放松下来。因此，只要你的姿势能帮助你达到沉静放松的目的，对你来说就是最好的开始。\n你不必盘腿，坐在椅子上，床边都可以。如果你会盘腿，那就盘腿，盘不好，那就散盘。\n听上去，冥想好像对坐姿没有要求，对不对？\n其实也不对。\n冥想要求你安静与放松。静坐，就不能摇晃。放松，就得让肌肉少受力。要想减少肌肉受力身子不摇晃，要点非常简单，就是中正二字。然而做到，却不容易。\n中正，指的是身体的中正。而坐姿下，支撑身体，使其保持中正的，是我们的脊椎。\n所以，中正也就是我们脊柱的中正。\n脊椎柱正，要讲究平衡。不能让自己的身体歪，若歪了，就会有的肌肉受力多，有的肌肉受力少。若歪坐的久了，受力多的肌肉就会更紧张，无法放松不舒服，就会跟受力少的肌肉换一换。一换，就会动。\n如何保持中正？\n首先，你的骨盆应稍稍前倾，让脊柱正好位于两边大腿中央的上方，亦即支撑你身体重量的两点之间。\n其次，腰部挺直， 第三，微微挺胸 第四，脖子直立 第五，头部端正，目视前方，不低头，不歪头。 第六，脊柱自然弯曲，不额外着力。\n有的修行者说，想想你最有尊严的坐姿该是什么样子的，就那样坐。\n叠石\n有尊严的坐着，是帮助你检查自己坐姿的一个方式。因为坐姿不端的时候，人很难感到自豪。\n而我，有另一个办法，帮助自己坐好。\n想起冥想坐姿，我的头脑里尝尝是升起这样一个意象：\n人的脊柱有三十三块椎骨组成。其中，颈椎七块，胸椎十二块，腰椎五块，五块骶椎合成骶骨一块，四块尾椎合成尾骨一块。想象端坐的过程，就是在尾骨上放骶骨，骶骨上摞腰椎，腰椎上叠胸椎，胸椎上垒颈椎，最后，把你的头颅摆上去。让它们一个叠一个的摆放稳定。\n就像是禅宗园林中的“叠石”一般。\n叠石，在藏族地区被称为玛尼堆。最初称曼扎，意为曼陀罗。是由大小不等的石头集垒起来的、具有灵气的石堆。\n如果你没有玩儿过叠石，可以去路边找几块乱石试一试。当你能把几块乱石叠起来，你自己的内心就会宁静起来。\n现在，你就把你的脊椎当作叠石的“玩具”，把它们堆叠起来，使其中正吧。你会发现，这个过程，本身，就是正念。\n无论你我怎样认为，有人相信，这样把石头垒起来就可以聚集灵气。\n冥想的坐姿，往玄处说，就是用脊柱做叠石，做玛尼堆，做灵气之导引。\n端正的坐姿，脊柱的叠石，就是冥想的基础。每个初学冥想的人，最初的一到三个月，每天都应该练习几分钟的端坐。\n叠石\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n我近期些的有关冥想的其他文章:\n2022-04-22 Fri. 冥想与呼吸\n2022-04-15 Fri. 有关简单冥想练习的问答\n2022-04-08 Fri. 简单冥想\n盘腿虽不是入门必须，但……\n如果坐姿对你来说并不是最舒适的姿势，那就不要勉强自己。\n冥想不一定非要坐着。\n你也可以站着冥想，躺着冥想。\n甚至，走路，甚至跑步时冥想。\n当然，运动中冥想，一定要在安全的地方，且不能闭眼了，也不推荐初学者尝试，要求比较高。\n但，脊柱的中正，始终是你在冥想中应当做到的。\n而保持脊柱中正的练习本身，也是静心，正念，和冥想的过程。\n既然坐着都不是必须，那么盘腿就更不是必须了。\n不过，话说回来，如果你愿意练习一下盘腿坐，用盘腿坐的姿势来练习冥想，那也绝对是有好处的。\n如果你不会盘腿，那么，在练习并学会保持脊柱中正的坐姿之后。下一步，就可以考虑学盘腿了。",
