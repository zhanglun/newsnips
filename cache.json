          "description": "theklf4: \n虽然我能理解这是为了防止用户忘记密码，我手上的三星 OneUI 也有这个设计，但这真的非常不安全，经常在公共场合因为这个功能必须输入 PIN 才能解锁。\n我知道 PIN 只在此设备上有效，其它人必须要接触设备才能使用 PIN 获得控制权限。\n但输入 PIN 的 10 数字键盘（我知道可以用数字字母的）真的很容易被偷窥（或被公共场合的[低清]摄像头有意或无意拍到），6~12 位 PIN 非常容易被人记住。而且能够看到 PIN 的人基本上都是身边的人，因此这是一个很严重的安全隐患，因为一旦你的设备不在身上，他们（通常是同事 / 同学 / 家人）就能通过你的 PIN 解锁你的设备。我相信大部分人应该不希望别人乱翻你的聊天记录或账号密码吧，即使是家人。\n除此之外，iOS 上的密码管理器在 Face ID(或 Touch ID)无法通过的情况下只能通过主密码或管理器的 PIN 解锁，不能通过系统 PIN （即锁屏密码）解锁，但 Windows 上的可以（我测试了 Bitwarden 和 1Password ，他们在开启生物识别解锁的情况下调的都是凭据管理器的 Windows Hello ，无法区分 PIN 和生物识别（物理 Key 貌似可以））。虽然 Windows 没有 x 天必须输入一次锁屏密码的设计，但我相信相当大部分用户（尤其是 PIN 中不含易于获取的个人资料或纯随机 PIN 的）所有个人设备使用的都是系统的 PIN 。而大部分 Windows 设备显然无法随身携带，能够被别有用心的人轻易解锁并导出保存密码，甚至直接安装远控马，而桌面系统排查起来显然非常复杂。\n再说说我认为的好设计。聊天软件 Signal 每隔一段时间会提示你确认 PIN ，你可以自己选择任意时间和场合来确认。我觉得 iOS 也可以这样做，或者至少提供一个选项让希望这样做的，对隐私有一定追求的用户这样做。但我没有注意到一个手机厂商提供这个功能。\n因为我发现 90% V 友都不读帖子内容就回复，没想到更好的方法，只能在标题加一堆！并在帖子内容滥用一级标题。我在任何帖子下都不需要和我帖子完全无关的回复，我认为这也和 V 站所宣扬的发表高信息量内容理念不符，看不惯的欢迎 Block（不需要在回复中告诉我，谢谢！）",

          "description": "自 1994 年面世以来，红帽 Linux 已经陪伴开发者们走过了将近 30 年的旅程。2014 年红帽吸纳了 CentOS 社区主要成员包括当时的项目领导者、核心项目贡献者。Red Hat 和 CentOS 项目联手，目的是开发用于企业 IT 的下一代 Linux 创新技术。这些年，我们看到开源模型继续蓬勃发展，推动了 Linux 容器、Kubernetes、微服务、无服务器等的兴起。鉴于社区推动的创新步伐迅速，社区领导层在 2019 年决定向 CentOS Linux 社区引入一个新模式：CentOS Stream，将社区工作转向上游。CentOS Stream 是一个面向开发者的发行版，旨在帮助社区成员、红帽合作伙伴和其他人在更稳定和可预测的 Linux 生态系统中充分利用开源创新。\n\n对最终用户影响最大的是 CentOS Linux 7 和 8 逐渐停止维护和更新。现有 CentOS Linux 操作系统用户如何应对？有哪些策略和实践经验可以借鉴？面对广大用户和开发者的普遍问题，亚马逊云科技 Tech Talk 特别邀请红帽高级解决方案架构师朱贺带来主题为《CentOS 操作系统停止维护后的对应方案与技术实践》的相关技术分享。\nCentOS 停更后，Linux 生态系统变化\n\n很多开发者无法理清 Linux 生态系统中各种版本之间的关系。那么我们首先做一个回顾，从 2014 年开始，红帽企业级 Linux 生态系统形成了 Fedora、RHEL 和 CentOS Linux 协同发展的局面。社区上游通过 Fedora 面向广大开发工程师提供桌面操作系统的持续创新和技术架构整合，大约每 6 个月发布一个版本；中游是红帽企业级 Linux，主要面向广大企业和应用开发商，特点是稳定、安全和性能优化，产品迭代和发展节奏有条不紊；下游就是社区领导的 CentOS Linux ，面向成本敏感用户和生态开发者。CentOS Linux 版本，产品迭代节奏紧跟 RHEL，用户在零成本获取的同时，一样可以享受到红帽 RHEL 的产品优势。\n\n\n\n7 年后， CentOS Linux 社区在 2021 年开始做出调整，逐步停更处于下游定位的 CentOS Linux 7、8 版本。CentOS 社区主要工作将转向 RHEL 上游，并开发维护新的 CentOS Linux 版本——CentOS Stream。\n点击查看原文>",
