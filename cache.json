          "description": "日前，百度对外分享了其在物联网的智能化道路上的最新思考、实践和总结。6月下旬，2021百度智能云“云智技术论坛”智能物联网专场在苏州举办。会上，百度智能云技术专家及合作伙伴共同探讨了物联网在智能化方向的前沿基础及应用技术，分享了打造AIoT最佳应用实践的经验。\n智联网思维\n\n在百度看来，当前“万物互联”的发展关键词是“连接”、“对话”和“智能”。“连接”层面需要具备亿级规模设备连接的能力支持，而低延时连接技术在无人车、远程驾驶等场景下，也面临着新的技术挑战。\n\n“对话”意在赋予万物对话能力，涉及到数字化控制、语音、视觉和虚拟现实等技术。“智能”则是在连接和对话能力的基础上，将AI、大数据处理和分析等技术能力，深入融合到各行各业的应用场景。\n\n“我们的思维方式要从传统的物联网思维转到智联网思维，考虑的不再是一个个的传感器以及把数据放在一起，而是如何把智能做深入融合，给行业带来新的机会和方法。”百度副总裁马杰表示，希望用AI来给IoT拓展新的场景，增加网联化和数据价值，完成用AI唤醒并赋能万物的使命。\n\n考虑到稳定性和功耗以及成本等因素，现在每一个设备都需要做得简单可靠、少耗电、少算力，那如何在低算力、低功耗的环境下，提供AI能力？对此，马杰举了两个例子：\n点击查看原文>",
