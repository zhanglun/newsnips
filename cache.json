          "description": "wasd6267016: 迫于最近有了移动开发需求（穿梭多个城市，可以不带鼠标键盘显示器），自己又是游戏开发，需要 windows + 强大的多核性能 + 中等的 gpu 性能，所以在寻找对应的产品，但是貌似没找到很符合需求的，分享一下自己的了解和思考：\n1 为什么不是游戏本：看上去很符合需求，现在的游戏本性能释放都很不错，还带屏幕和键盘，但是对我来说有一个巨大缺点：噪音。据我所知，大部分游戏本在 cpu 和 gpu 高负载的情况下，都是噪音巨大无比，堪比飞机起飞（夸张：D ），然而作为一个游戏开发，大部分时间是要开着引擎，相当于长期 cpu 中负载+gpu 高负载，大的噪音会干扰工作。也能解决，比如拿远点，也不是不能忍，所以就当成基准方案吧。\n同时游戏本的屏幕和电池都是我不太需要的成本，所以游戏本不能算完美贴合。（不过看看后面的产品觉得这部分额外成本也不算什么了）\n2 由 xbox series s 想到的，xss 纸面性能不算弱，然后体积和噪音控制的都很好，如果主机仿造这个设计，也可以有对位的产品，理论上完全能做到\n3 然后我就找到了 intel 的 nuc ，11 代幻影峡谷，i7 + 2060 ，i7 算是低压的，性能一般顶多算个 i5 ，显卡 2060 释放不错，90%桌面版的性能。最惊奇的是体积控制很好，比 xss 还要小巧（除了电源），同时噪音很小，比普通台式机都要小。缺点：贵，比同性能配置 itx 要贵 2000 左右，基本贵了一半了。也关注了最新的猛兽峡谷，一样的缺点，太贵，太贵。\n4 然后开始接触到一些迷你主机，比如 deskmini ，amd 系列，还有 12 代 intel 系列，都是集成显卡，2022 年的集成显卡性能不知道能不能满足我的需求，有待测试。价格比同配置 itx 也贵一些，但是能接受，缺点也很明显，没有独立显卡，gpu 性能锁死在了集成显卡级别。\n5 我的设想：思路可以转变一下，不一定是要把台式电脑做小，完全可以从游戏本出发，把游戏本做大。既然有游戏本在，能不能去掉键盘和屏幕，同时扩大一点机身内部空间，让噪音小一点，如果能做到和同配置游戏本一样的性能释放和较小的噪音，价位保持相当，我觉得可能就是迷你主机的完美状态了\n甚至可以直接用笔记本的主板和 cpu gpu ，装到合适大小的机箱内，（不用屏幕键盘电池）\n这样一夹逼，同性能的迷你主机价格应该在普通台式和游戏本之前，怎么也不至于像 nuc 那么昂贵\n最终我的选择：（？）\n目前想尝试的是，把我的先马趣造主机用行李箱来回搬运，感觉会很重，不会很轻便。后面也可以考虑换更小的 itx 机箱，但是重量问题无法避免\n实在不行就买游戏本把（一个断头的游戏本可能更实惠）",

          "description": "大家都知道我喜欢好的调查，那么让我们来看看云原生计算基金会（Cloud Native Computing Foundation，CNCF）2021年的年度调查。 他们询问了2302名受访者是如何使用Kubernetes以及其他更通用的云原生工具的。 报告的主要结论是：Kubernetes的使用已经成为主流，因为报告的副标题是2021年：“Kubernetes跨越鸿沟的一年”。\n \n​​今年的调查有很多主题，但本文仅介绍我最感兴趣的三个主题。\n \n成为主流\n当CNCF的调查以“Kubernetes跨越鸿沟的一年”为副标题时，就意味着“Kubernetes正在进入主流”。让我们来检查一下这个说法。首先：“鸿沟”？\n \n这与创新扩散理论（Diffusion of Innovations Theory）相关，杰弗里·摩尔（Geoffrey Moore）在其著作《跨越鸿沟》（Crossing the Chasm）中指出，软件市场的采用经历了五个阶段：创新者、早期采用者、早期大众、后期大众和落后者。各个群体对新的、难以使用的软件的容忍程度都是逐渐降低的。创新者会忍受一切，因为他们喜欢使用新技术，落后者甚至可能会对你的新软件不感兴趣。在有远见的人和早期大众之间有一条鸿沟，这是大多数软件公司无法跨越的。这就是为什么，对于一个供应商（现在也包括公有云）来说，对一小部分客户有效的方法不再适用于其他所有人。他们必须“扩展”他们的产品管理、工程、支持、销售和营销，以扩展到组织中，这些组织每天都有越来越多日常的、正常的、甚至是无聊的问题。因此，摩尔的模型是一个很好的模型，它解释了Kubernetes是否以及是何时成为主流的。\n \n让我们来算算看Kubernetes是否已经跨越了鸿沟。在摩尔模型中，每一组的表现呈现出了钟形曲线的形势（令人惊讶！），创新者占2.5%，早期采用者占13.5%，早期大众占34%，后期大众占34%，落后者（谢天谢地！）只占16%。为了跨越鸿沟，你需要让16%（2.5%+13.5%）的人使用你的软件。如果你在17%到50%（2.5%+13.5%+34%）范围内，你就进入了主流领域。\n点击查看原文>",
