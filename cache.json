You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "一、前言       \n携程金融从成立至今，整体架构经历了从0到1再到10的变化，其中有多个场景使用了缓存来提升服务质量。从系统层面看，使用缓存的目的无外乎缓解DB压力（主要是读压力），提升服务响应速度。引入缓存，就不可避免地引入了缓存与业务DB数据的一致性问题，而不同的业务场景，对数据一致性的要求也不同。本文将从以下两个场景介绍我们的一些缓存实践方案：\n\n\n最终一致性分布式缓存场景\n\n强一致性分布式缓存场景\n\n\n注：我们DB用的是MySQL，缓存介质用的是携程高可用Redis服务，存储介质的选型及存储服务的高可用不是本文重点，后文也不再做特别说明。\n二、最终一致性分布式缓存场景\n2.1 场景描述\n经过几年演进，携程金融形成了自顶向下的多层次系统架构，如业务层、平台层、基础服务层等，其中用户信息、产品信息、订单信息等基础数据由基础平台等底层系统产生，服务于所有的金融系统，对这部分基础数据我们引入了统一的缓存服务（系统名utag），缓存数据有三大特点：全量、准实时、永久有效，在数据实时性要求不高的场景下，业务系统可直接调用统一的缓存查询接口。\n      \n我们的典型使用场景有：风控流程、APP入口信息提示等，而对数据一致性要求高的场景依然需要走实时的业务接口查询。引入缓存前后系统架构对比如下：\n\n\n\n点击查看原文>",
