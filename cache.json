          "description": "随着移动互联网和云计算技术的迅猛发展，越来越多的数据在云环境下进行存储、共享和计算，云环境下的数据安全与隐私保护也逐渐成为学术界以及工业界关注的热点问题。目前阶段，隐私保护技术主要基于密码算法及协议（如安全多方计算、同态加密等）完成场景落地，其优点主要在于具有较高的安全性和可靠性，然而，由于这些算法或协议的实现依赖于大量复杂计算（如乘法循环群上的乘法、指数运算，Pairing运算，格上的数学运算等），因此存在较大的性能瓶颈，难以在实际场景中大规模应用。\n\n作为基于密码学的隐私保护技术的一种替代方案，可信执行环境（Trusted execution environment，TEE）基于硬件安全的CPU实现了基于内存隔离的安全计算，可在保证计算效率的前提下完成隐私保护的计算。\n\n本文将阐释梳理TEE的概念定义及发展脉络，剖析TEE与基于密码学的隐私保护技术的对比及其在联邦学习中的应用，最后介绍TEE的现有框架和相关应用。\nTEE定义与发展脉络\n概念及辨析：TEE与REE\n\nTEE是一种具有运算和储存功能，能提供安全性和完整性保护的独立处理环境。其基本思想是：在硬件中为敏感数据单独分配一块隔离的内存，所有敏感数据的计算均在这块内存中进行，并且除了经过授权的接口外，硬件中的其他部分不能访问这块隔离的内存中的信息。以此来实现敏感数据的隐私计算。\n\n富执行环境(Rich Execution Environment，REE)指的是操作系统运行时的环境中，可以运行如Android、IOS等通用的OS（Opreating System）。REE是一个容易受到攻击的开放环境，如敏感数据的窃取、移动支付盗用等等。而TEE是中央处理器上的一个安全区域，能够保证敏感数据在隔离和可信的环境内被处理，从而免受来自REE中的软件攻击。此外，与其他的安全执行环境相比，TEE可以端到端地保护TA(Trusted Application)的完整性和机密性，能够提供更强的处理能力和更大的内存空间。在下图这一典型的可信执行环境架构中，TEE内部为REE中的软件提供了接口，使得REE中的软件可以调用TEE对数据进行处理，但不会泄露敏感数据。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "IPO未满一年，被迫出售中国业务\n \n3月17日，路透社援引知情人士消息，无人驾驶卡车初创公司图森未来正在考虑出售其在中国的业务并专注于美国市场。该决定是在这家初创公司与美国政府达成协议，出于美国安全考虑限制中国部门访问数据之后做出的。\n \n一位确认图森未来即将出售中国业务的消息人士称，在中美两国的严格监管之下，图森未来拟以10亿美元出售其中国业务。目前图森未来已与包括私募股权公司博裕资本在内的几家中国投资者接洽，以寻找潜在买家。\n \n此外，消息人士还称，在图森未来解决“安全问题”之后，图森未来的业务有望独立发展。\n \n去年4月，图森未来通过在纳斯达克的首次公开募股筹集了超过10亿美元，成为自动驾驶领域全球首个IPO。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "近日，CVPR 2022放榜，基于昇腾CANN的AI论文《Interactive Image Synthesis with Panoptic Layout Generation》强势上榜。这为AI发烧友们开辟了一条新的图像生成之路随手选择几个类别的基础元素，并做大小和位置的拖动，便能自动生成一副摄影作品，堪比专业摄影师！\n\n\n\nCVPR全称IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition，是计算机视觉领域三大顶会之一，并且是唯一一个年度学术会议。在快速更新迭代的计算机学科中，CVPR已然成为了计算机视觉领域的“顶流”。\n \n本论文基于交互式的图像生成，提出基于全景布局（Panoptic Layout）辅助图像生成的方法，即PLGAN（Panoptic Layout Generation）算法，提高了交互场景下生成图像的质量及其稳定性。该论文在COCO-Stuff和VG两个公开数据集和自行收集的Landscape风景数据集上，进行了实验验证并取得了很好的效果。目前已经在华为Atlas系列服务器上实现了该算法，其配备了昇腾AI处理器提供算力支持，并借助异构计算架构CANN（Compute Architecture for Neural Networks）充分释放硬件澎湃算力，发挥极致AI性能。\n \n论文链接：https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02104\n点击查看原文>",
