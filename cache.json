          "description": "过去的 10 年间，软件的架构发生了巨大的变化，从早先流行的单体 MVC 架构，变成了所谓的 5：5 开，即分布式 vs 单体。只是呢，有大量的软件开发人员，无法看到系统的全貌，又或者是从单体的思维转变过来。于是，哪怕是在使用了微服务的情况下，但是实现的却又是一个一个的单体，只是它们变成了“分布式的单体”。\n\n架构治理变成一个急待解决的问题。\n我们所面临的挑战\n\n作为一个架构师或者是软件开发人员，在架构治理上，我们面对的诸多挑战有：\n\n\n设计与实现不匹配。设计的软件架构与真正实施后的架构，存在着巨大的差异。而这个差异，往往需要编码上线、乃至一段时间之后才能发现\n\n没有规范/不遵守规范。作为一个资深的开发人员，我们制定了一系列的规范，但是没有多少团队人员愿意遵守\n\n代码量巨大，难以识别问题。一个由十几个或者几十个微服务创建的系统，往往难以快速发现它们之间错综复杂的关系\n\n架构模型的每个层级都可能出错。如服务间 API 耦合、代码间耦合、数据库耦合等等\n点击查看原文>",
