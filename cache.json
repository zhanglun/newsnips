          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

          "description": "Belt Finance 是一种基于币安智能链（BSC）的去中心化借贷协议，5 月 29 日，攻击者通过智能合约开始对 4Belt BLP 池发起闪电贷攻击。\n\n据悉，攻击方创建了一份使用 PancakeSwap 进行闪电贷的智能合约，并利用 BeltBUSD 池及其底层策略协议先后对合约内容执行了 8 次，借此攫取了高达 6234753 BUSD 的收益。BeltBUSD 金库用户遭受 21.36% 的资金损失，而 4Belt 币池用户则遭受 5.51% 资金损失。\n\n攻击过程\n\n据 Belt Finance 团队介绍，攻击者首先利用 PancakeSwap 中的漏洞获得了总值 3.9 亿 BUSD 的闪电贷额度，这已经接近 PancakeSwap 上全部 BUSD 池所能提供的最大 BUSD 金额。之后，攻击方将其中约 2 亿 BUSD 存入 BeltBUSD 金库（使用 Venus 策略协议），并借此极大提升了 Venus 策略的整体占比。\n\n在攻击活动发生之前，BeltBUSD 金库的协议比例为：Venus 约占 6000 万 BUSD，Alpaca 占 6000 万 BUSD，Ellipsis 占 6000 万 BUSD，而 ForTube 约占 2000 万 BUSD，总量约为 2 亿 BUSD。但在吸纳了攻击者的存入之后，Venus 掌握了约 2.6 亿 BUSD，也让 BeltBUSD 的总储量快速提升至 4 亿左右。\n\n攻击者同时还将 1.9 亿 BUSD 转移至 Ellipsis.fi 3pool，并将这 1.9 亿 BUSD 兑换为约 1.695 亿 USDT。此次兑换令 Ellipsis 3pool LP 值在短时间内猛增。3pool LP 的供应关系虽然没有改变，但这 2150 万美元的差值仍然令 3pool LP 快速增值约 3%。这又将 4Belt 池 Ellipsis 策略的币值占比由 6000 万 BUSD 增加至 6180 万 BUSD，也让整个 BeltBUSD 金库总值由 4 亿 BUSD 增加至 4.018 亿 BUSD（涨幅约 0.5%）。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "RxJava是Java对于反应式编程的一个实现框架，是一个基于事件的、提供实现强大且优雅的异步调用程序的代码库。18年以来，由淘宝技术部发起的应用架构升级项目，希望通过反应式架构、全异步化的改造，提升系统整体性能和机器资源利用率，减少网络延时，资源的重复使用，并为业务快速创新提供敏捷的架构支撑。在闲鱼的基础链路诸如商品批量更新、订单批量查询等，都利用了RxJava的异步编程能力。\n\n不过，RxJava是入门容易精通难，一不小心遍地坑。今天来一起看下RxJava的使用方式、基本原理、注意事项。\n开始之前\n让我们先看下，使用RxJava之前，我们曾经写过的回调代码存在的痛点。当我们的应用需要处理用户事件、异步调用时，随着流式事件的复杂性和处理逻辑的复杂性的增加，代码的实现难度将爆炸式增长。比如我们有时需要处理多个事件流的组合、处理事件流的异常或超时、在事件流结束后做清理工作等，如果需要我们从零实现，势必要小心翼翼地处理回调、监听、并发等很多棘手问题。还有一个被称作“回调地狱”的问题，描述的是代码的不可读性。\nCode 1.1\n\n\n\n以上js代码有两个明显槽点：1.由于传入的层层回调方法，代码结尾出现一大堆的 }) ；2. 代码书写的顺序与代码执行的顺序相反：后面出现回调函数会先于之前行的代码先执行。\n点击查看原文>",
