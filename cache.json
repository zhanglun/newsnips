          "description": "困惑的概念\n相信接触过传统企业数字化转型项目的话，你应该都听过敏态与稳态这两个词。敏稳结合的转型方法在大多数的客户转型咨询方案中会提及。但随着客户越来越多，其上下文也越来越复杂，我们发现在和客户交流敏稳态的时候理解上会有很大差异，最直接的表现就是词汇越来越多，但对它们的理解并不一致，例如：敏态、稳态；敏捷、精益；双模、双态、双速等， 所以本文尝试梳理这些概念的含义以及彼此之间的关系。\n“敏态”与“稳态”\n数字化是近些年传统企业的转型方向，其中敏捷转型是企业在数字化转型中很重要的一部分。一方面企业引入敏捷方法帮助他们适应数字时代的市场变化的要求。另一面由于传统企业往往业务规模庞大，系统逻辑复杂，长时间使用ERP等传统商业套件构建的中后台系统很难适应数字化转型时提出的业务高响应力要求。为了应对这种挑战，咨询公司Gartner于2013年底首先提出了双模IT（Bimodal IT）概念：Mode 1 is optimized for areas that are more predictable and well-understood.Mode 2 is exploratory, experimenting to solve new problems and optimized for areas of uncertainty. 按照Gartner的描述：\n\n\n模式1是为了优化那些确定性高，可预测的领域。这里Gartner举了个例子，比如我们去重写一个遗留系统，以使其适应数字化的要求；\n\n模式2是为了优化不确定的领域，应对需要探索以及实验来解决的新问题的。这个相对比较好理解，比如我们开发一个新产品，要将其不断推向用户以验证产品是否符合市场需求。\n\n\n下图Gartner很好的总结了两种模式的特点：\n\n\n\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "行为预测是自动驾驶系统的隐含层\n\n实现汽车的自动驾驶被认为是我们这一代最大的工程挑战之一¹。最主要的原因之一，是自动驾驶汽车需要在复杂且多变的环境中，实现安全且舒适的驾驶行为。简单来说，自动驾驶系统的输入是通过大量传感器收集的自身及周围环境的各种信息，输出是刹车、油门、方向盘等相关的驾驶动作。\n\n实现一个完整的自动驾驶系统，有很多种不同的方案，其中最大胆的可能是基于深度学习和强化学习，训练一个端到端的模型，即以原始的传感器数据作为输入，模型直接输出控制参数。然而这样的方案，目前还仅停留在学术探索的阶段，离实际的工程应用还比较远。\n\n\n\n\n图1. 自动驾驶系统示意图\n\n工程实践中，一般采取分而治之的方法实现，也就是分为感知、预测、规划与控制等具有一定上下游关系的子系统。这样的划分为系统带来了比较好的可解释性，方便持续的迭代和改进。此外，这样也是符合直觉的：首先，通过感知模块得到周围环境和交通参与者的当前状态；然后，通过预测模块预判其它交通参与者未来一段时间的行为；最后，基于对环境的感知和预测，自车做出合理的决策和轨迹规划。可见，行为预测类似于一个隐含层，通过它可以衔接上下游，也就是综合当前和历史的环境信息给出对于未来的预测，为下游的决策和规划提供及时和准确的信息。\n\n行为预测的基本方法和框架\n\n▍1. 行为预测方法从简单到复杂的演进过程\n\n\n图2. 行为预测方法从简单到复杂的演进过程示意²\n点击查看原文>",
