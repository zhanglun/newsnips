You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "一、零售数据五十年\n1、分销阶段：零售启蒙（80s-90s）\n\n\n先来讲讲零售数据五十年，因为我过往的经历主要在零售的领域，在过去20年时间，零售在国内市场发生了很大的变化。在比较早期的时候，在80年代到90年，外企进入中国渠道快速发展需要借助经销商拓展市场，这一阶段以经销商为运营核心，很多数据的研究与采集都是围绕经销商系统的搭建而沉淀下来经销商数据，其中较有代表性的是DMS系统（分销管理系统），是由英语distribution management system直译过来，经销商可能会同时装好几个管理系统。\n2、门店管理：逐渐深入（90s-10s）\n后期随着门店管理深入，发现只管理和看到经销商的管理数据是不够的。除此之外，在90年到2010年，是零售终端非常强势崛起的时期，前期以线下大型卖场，像沃尔玛、家乐福，还有一些地域性的零售终端为主，后期慢慢向线上的零售终端阿里、京东靠拢，这个阶段被称为门店管理阶段、管理门店数据延伸出后续的用户数据为核心的整套研究体系。我们会去看商品在终端的一个零售价格，一个品类在终端的交易量和交易额。正由于这些需求的存在，此阶段产生了一个大家可能很熟悉的研究公司，尼尔森。它是做零售终端调研数据的，跟零售商做数据交换，数据频率相对比较高，而且数据质量相对非常好，是可以达到每一笔订单的交易，每一个商品的交易。这些恰恰是制造商非常需要的数据。\n\n举个例子，零售终端会把购买频次最高的生鲜品类陈列在卖场最里面，消费者需要一直逛到最里面才能购买，以一个品类带动其他品类的购买，当时门店的陈列管理都是完全围绕着以终端门店为运营核心延伸出来的。\n3、用户运营：演变至今（21世纪10s-20s）\n从2010年到现在，随着互联网的逐步深入，大家知道互联网诞生起于电商，所有数据的沉淀基本上都以用户为运营核心。用户登录网站沉淀浏览记录、购买记录……都是以消费者在网上注册的ID展开数据链路以及研究，这个阶段称为“以用户为运营核心的用户运营阶段”，在此阶段最常接触的就是CRM、会员管理/忠诚度管理、用户生命周期，月贡献值有多少、看LTV模型预测消费者的购买潜力与行为。\n点击查看原文>",
