          "description": "chmn78: \n上个月我刚买的手机在小区里面跑步的时候不慎弄丢了，才不到半小时的功夫就被人拿走。后来我调物业监控发现是被另一栋的 50 多岁的男的捡走了，之后让物业上门索要无果，对方说是自己捡到的，有权力不还。后来我报警了，警察也给对方打了电话，但一样没用，警察说这属于民事纠纷，他们也不能强制要求他还手机。我让社区出面，还咨询了社区律师，律师称他们也只能协调，但对方不还，只能按《民法典》打官司。那都不知何年马月了。\n幸好我跟物业私下关系较好，物业偷偷给了我那个人的门牌号、手机号、微信，我通过企查查查到了对方名下一个小微公司，还知道对方和老婆两个人住一起，物业说上门协调的时候他老婆比他还凶。\n现在我想知道有什么不暴露自己的方式报复这家人？\n比如有什么办法能知道他们车牌号，然后我可以在摄像头拍不到的时候放轧钉。\n或者网上曝光他的手机号，但不知道怎么才能最大效果给他带来骚扰。\n还有就是举报他公司，但不知道怎么举报能让他受罚。\n有没有有大神给建议，当然你们就当闲聊，我不一定真执行，免得你们觉得是在教唆。",

          "description": "openminder: \n前言：Web3 与 DAO\n1 ） Web3 的认知表述\nWeb3 目前已经有了相当热度，公众一致认为是移动互联网 Web2 技术的下一代，其中区块链表现很突出，被推举为 Web3 的代表（元宇宙的概念和目标太宏大，感觉其实现产品化会从 Web3 跨越到 Web4 ）。确实，与几年前早期区块链技术相比，现在的区块链领域投入相当大的资金和人力，公链的性能有了不错的提升。\n2 ） DAO ，未来可能的一种（公司）组织形式\n以太坊官网关于 DAO 的专栏页面： https://ethereum.org/en/dao/，以太坊官网几年前就有 DAO 的描述，现在更是有突出的位置，已经诞生了形形色色的 DAO 。\n3 ）币圈和链圈\n币圈和链圈是一对相互依存的孪生兄弟，币圈出经济模型，链圈搞技术方案，币圈和链圈这种完美组合使得在 Web3 十分亮眼。\n制定目标：Web3 技术的活学活用，创建一个 DAO ，“DevrFiDao”\nDevrFiDao 是一个改进型的 DAO ，只面向 Web3 开发者的 DAO ，典型成员应该是具备（或准备转型） Web3 开发的个人开发者或工作室。其成员不是雇佣关系，而是透明化的参与和共治。未来合格的 Web3 开发人员将会十分缺乏，无法满足 Web3 的快速发展，个人开发者靠单打独斗是无法参与到中大型 Web3 开源项目，DevrFiDao 可以提供一种协同学习和开发的模式。\n有关 DevrFiDao 的 Q&A：\n1 ） Q：学习 Web3 技术的目的是什么？\nA：因为 Web3 技术是 Web2 的下一代技术，学习它是为未来做技术储备；\n2 ） Q：如何避免人性的缺陷（惰性 /贪婪）？\nA：在 DAO 引入透明化的自治管理（规则 /业务透明），贡献大的成员层级高 /激励多。\n3 ） Q：如何防止社群不活跃，一潭死水？\nA：需要有一些能力强、有一定奉献精神的核心高级成员（领军人物 /九袋长老）推动 DAO 组织的发展，主持战略带动其他成员。\n4 ） Q：加入 DevrFiDao 有什么好处和坏处？\nA：好处是协调学习 Web3 技术，组团匹配 Web3 开发者黑客松和项目；坏处是需要投入时间精力参与 DAO 的自治活动。\n近期计划：\n线上邀约 DAO 核心成员（奠基人），使用 TG/Discord 组，推进 DAO 核心层组建和规则制定。\n联系方式：（ TG ）@DevrFiDao\n截止日期：2022.5.31",

          "description": "5 月 9 日，Cloudflare 在其官方博客宣布，将与 Node.js 和 Deno 开源项目的核心贡献者合作，成立一个新的社区组，命名为 WinterCG（Web-interoperable Runtimes Community Group），该项目汇集了三个最大的 JavaScript 环境，为开发人员提供了灵活性和选择，同时创建边缘计算的未来标准。通过一套通用标准，允许在 Node.js、Deno 和 Cloudflare 无服务器环境中编写可移植的应用程序，同时不再需要重写代码，实现“编写一次，随处运行”的承诺。\n\nCloudflare 联合创始人兼首席执行官 Matthew Prince 表示，“这是一个以前无法实现的壮举。JavaScript 正在被数以百万计的开发人员使用，也是一般开发者学习的第一种语言。到目前为止，JavaScript 标准完全集中在前端，比如浏览器。” Matthew Prince 补充道，“通过对核心 JavaScript API 的标准化，同时兼顾到前端和后端，这样可以授权前端开发者以一种熟悉的方式，更多更便捷地访问后端。”\n\n针对这个消息，我们采访了 Deno 核心贡献者 justjavac（迷渡）老师，他表示：“这个社区早该成立了！这样可以让云计算或者边缘计算的平台提供和 Web 一致的 API，而不是各自开发自己的 API。对于社区开发者来说，不再需要额外学习一套 API，写一套代码就可以部署到不同平台。”\n\nWinterCG 社区成立的初衷是什么？\n\n据 Cloudflare 官方说明， WinterCG 社区组的本质在于为 JavaScript 运行时提供一个空间，以便于在 API 互操作性方面进行协作。这种协作大致包括三个方面，分别是：运行时之间的讨论；现有规范社区（WHATWG、W3C）中的 Web API 的提案，包括现有提案和新提案；完善和维护现有运行时行为的文档。\n\n对此，justjavac（迷渡） 认为，在 Node.js 发布的时候，还没有那么多的 Web API 规范，于是 Node.js 设计了一套服务器端 API，像 Deno 在设计之初就直接复用了 Web API，大部分 JavaScript 开发者都非常熟悉这些 API，比如 fetch、URL、TextEncoder 等。后来 WHATWG 制定了很多 Web API 规范，Node.js 的最近版本也开始添加了符合 WHATWG 规范的 API。\n点击查看原文>",
