          "description": "随着软件和算法对我们生活方方面面产生的影响越来越大，人们对它们的兴趣也越来越大，并且更加关注算法是如何影响社会、经济和政治的。\n \n然而，对算法的大多数社会研究都将它们视为自主运作、晦涩难懂的黑箱。这种观点孤立地看待算法，将它们与人类元素分离开来，就导致我们得出错误的理解和结论。\n \n洛桑大学STS实验室博士后研究员Florian Jaton在《算法的构成》（The Constitution of Algorithms）一书中，尝试从内部探索算法，进而揭示了算法人性化的一面。\n \nJaton不是先找一个实用算法，试图弄清楚它是如何产生的，而是从看似不相关的实体（如人、欲望、文档、好奇心）开始，然后研究所有这些实体是如何聚在一起相互作用，形成我们所说的算法。\n \nJaton将人种学与基本事实、编程与算法制定方面的实践结合起来，从而发现了算法创建过程中所有那些细小但重要的细节和实践，并展示了我们和我们创造的算法是如何相互影响的。如此一来，他对算法构成的研究可以帮助我们发现新的方向，从而让我们的软件与我们的价值观保持一致。 \n点击查看原文>",
