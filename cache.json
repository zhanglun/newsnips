          "description": "这一裁决，到底符合不符合GPL的设计初衷？\n\n \n软件自由保护协会（SFC）在强制要求Vizio公布其SmartCast TV软件源代码的斗争当中，再次赢得重大司法胜利。\n \nSFC是一家促进开源软件并为GPL辩护的非营利组织，他们认为Vizio 未能遵守GPLv2及LGPLv2.21许可中提出的、在满足特定条件时公开源代码的条款，因此涉嫌违约。Vizio 回复说保护协会无权索取源代码。为此，保护协会起诉了Vizio，并代表其电视用户提出了赔偿请求。而Vizio在诉讼中希望将违约问题转化为联邦版权法范围内的争议案件。上周一，美联邦地方法院法官Josephine Staton表示支持软件自由保护协会，对Vizio给予了否定意见。\n \n保护协会政策研究员Bradley Kuhn在邮件采访中解释道，“Vizio宣称GPL只能视作版权许可、而非合同约定，因此要求将案件‘撤销’至联邦法院。我们则提出反驳，认为GPL协议既是版权许可、也是合同约定，其中的源代码条款明确向第三方（即下游用户）赋予了合同权利，要求甲方提供相应的完整源代码。”\n \nKuhn还提到，如果仅将GPL解释为版权许可，那么保护协会必定会提起上诉，因为其诉讼主张就是合同违约索赔、而非版权侵犯索赔。而且保护协会并未寻求金钱赔偿，只希望 Vizio 向所有购买其电视的客户提供源代码。法官也同意协会一方的观点，认为GPL既属于版权许可、也具有合同效力。这也意味着，不仅仅是开发人员，消费者也有权修改、共享和重新安装软件的修改版本。Vizio用户可能并不真想要设备的代码，但这个利害关系却足以改变开源权利的游戏规则。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "深度强化学习在自主解决复杂、高维问题方面的前景，引起了机器人、游戏和自动驾驶汽车等领域的极大兴趣。但是，要想有效地进行强化学习策略的训练，需要对大量的机器人状态和行为进行研究。这其中存在一定的安全风险，比如，在训练一个有腿机器人时，由于这类机器人自身不稳定，机器人在学习时很容易发生跌倒，这可能会造成机器人的损害。\n \n通过在计算机模拟中学习控制策略，然后将其部署在现实世界中，可以在一定程度上降低机器人发生损害的风险。但是，该方法往往要求解决模拟到现实的差距，即在模拟中训练的策略由于各种原因不能随时部署在现实世界中，比如部署中的传感器噪音或模拟器在训练中不够真实。解决这个问题的另一种方法，就是在现实世界中直接学习或微调控制策略。当然，最主要的挑战还是如何在学习过程中确保安全。\n \n在《腿部运动的安全强化学习《Safe Reinforcement Learning for Legged Locomotion》的论文中，我们提出了一个安全的强化学习框架，用于学习腿部运动，同时满足训练期间的安全约束。\n \n我们的目标是让机器人在现实世界中自主学习动作技巧，并且在学习过程中不会跌倒。我们的学习架构使用了一种双重策略的强化学习框架：一种将机器人从近乎不安全的状态中恢复过来的“安全恢复策略”，以及一种为执行所需控制任务而优化的“学习者策略”。安全学习框架在安全恢复策略和学习者策略之间进行切换，使机器人能够安全地获得新的、敏捷的动作能力。\n双重策略的强化学习框架\n \n点击查看原文>",
