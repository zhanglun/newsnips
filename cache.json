You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "前言\n众所周知，精确的推荐离不开大量埋点，常见的埋点采集方案是在响应用户行为操作的路径上进行埋点。但是由于 App 通常会有比较多界面和操作路径，主动埋点的维护成本就会非常大。所以行业的做法是无埋点，而无埋点实现需要 AOP 编程。\n\n一个常见的场景，比如想在UIViewController出现和消失的时刻分别记录时间戳用于统计页面展现的时长。要达到这个目标有很多种方法，但是 AOP 无疑是最简单有效的方法。Objective-C 的 Hook 其实也有很多种方式，这里以 Method Swizzle 给个示例。\n\n@interface UIViewController (MyHook)\n\n@end\n\n@implementation UIViewController (MyHook)\n\n+ (void)load {\n    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;\n    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{\n        /// 常规的 Method Swizzle封装\n        swizzleMethods(self, @selector(viewDidAppear:), @selector(my_viewDidAppear:));\n        /// 更多Hook\n    });\n}\n\n- (void)my_viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {\n  /// 一些Hook需要的逻辑\n\n  /// 这里调用Hook后的方法，其实现其实已经是原方法了。\n  [self my_viewDidAppear: animated];\n}\n\n@end\n\n接下来我们探讨一个具体场景：\nUICollectionView或者UITableView是 iOS 中非常常用的列表 UI 组件，其中列表元素的点击事件回调是通过delegate完成的。这里以UICollectionView为例，UICollectionView的delegate，有个方法声明，collectionView:didSelectItemAtIndexPath:，实现这个方法我们就可以给列表元素添加点击事件。\n我们的目标是 Hook 这个 delegate 的方法，在点击回调的时候进行额外的埋点操作。\n点击查看原文>",
