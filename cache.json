          "description": "一、当Kubernetes成为云原生事实标准，可观测性挑战随之而来\n\n当前，云原生技术以容器技术为基础，通过标准可扩展的调度、网络、存储、容器运行时接口来提供基础设施。同时，通过标准可扩展的声明式资源和控制器来提供运维能力，两层标准化推动了开发与运维关注点分离，各领域进一步提升规模化和专业化，达到成本、效率、稳定性的全面优化。\n\n在这样的大技术背景下，越来越多的公司引入了云原生技术来开发、运维业务应用。正因为云原生技术带来了越发纷繁复杂的可能性，业务应用出现了微服务众多、多语言开发、多通信协议的鲜明特征。同时，云原生技术本身将复杂度下移，给可观测性带来了更多挑战：\n\n\n\n\n1、混沌的微服务架构，多语言和多网络协议混杂\n业务架构因为分工问题，容易出现服务数量多，调用协议和关系非常复杂的现象，导致的常见问题包括：\n\n无法准确清晰了解、掌控全局的系统运行架构；\n\n无法回答应用之间的连通性是否正确；\n\n多语言、多网络调用协议带来埋点成本呈线性增长，且重复埋点ROI低，开发一般将这类需求优先级降低，但可观测数据又不得不采集。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "3 月 8 日，谷歌和Mandiant联合宣布，谷歌将以 54 亿美元收购网络安全公司 Mandiant。这是谷歌有史以来规模最大的收购之一，仅次于2011 年以 125 亿美元收购摩托罗拉手机部门 Mobility。\n \nMandiant （前身为 FireEye，去年更名为 Mandiant）是网络安全领域知名威胁情报公司，曾在第一时间发布 SolarWinds 供应链攻击技术细节。收购后，这家网络安全巨头将成为谷歌云的一部分。该交易预计将于今年晚些时候完成。\n \n谷歌云计算首席执行官Thomas Kurian在声明中说：“全球各地正面临着前所未有的网络安全挑战，以前攻击主要针对政府，现在攻击对象包含每个行业的公司。我们期待着Mandiant加入谷歌云，以进一步加强我们的安全运营套件和咨询服务，并帮助客户解决他们最看重的安全挑战。我们可以一起保护云，加速云计算的采用，最终让世界更安全。”\n \nMandiant 首席执行官Kevin Mandia在声明中表示：“网络安全是一项使命，并且是我们这一代人最重要的使命之一。我们很高兴能与谷歌云联手，我们将共同提供专业知识和情报，通过结合谷歌的网络安全分析与 Mandiant 的自动防御技术，有望改变安全行业。”\n \n今年二月，彭博社曾报道微软在与 Mandiant 洽谈收购一事，但微软最终没能完成与Mandiant的谈判，给出的原因是担心Mandiant的安全业务在战略上不够合适。\n点击查看原文>",
