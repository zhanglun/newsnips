          "description": "在创造性的设计与敲代码工作以外，开发者常常还需要腾出精力处理许多确定性、重复性高的工作，DevOps 工具链的管理就是其中一项。\n \n在软件研发生命周期的各个环节，工具的选型、打通、落地、维护都不是易事。\n \n许多云厂商因此推出一站式 DevOps 平台，用大而全的解决方案节省研发团队在 DevOps 工具链管理事务上投入的资源。一站式平台确实带来了便利，但这种便利往往建立在让渡部分选择自由的基础上。如果站在全局视角上，受限的选择权有时反而会损害研发效能。\n \n随着软件工程复杂化，微服务架构被广泛采用。服务被拆分成微服务，并由一个团队独立负责，每个服务都能灵活选择其架构，服务之间可能编程语言不同，部署方式和特点可能也不同。\n \n此时，一站式 DevOps 平台就难以满足微服务架构下各团队对于灵活性的需求。\n点击查看原文>",
