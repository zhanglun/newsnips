          "description": "akilawu: 这两天 airpods pro 的左边耳机使用的时候连不上了，右上角滑下来的控制中心里面只能看到右边耳机，左边连不上。长按重置重新连接的时候，弹窗动画能正常看到两个耳机和电量显示，但是戴进耳朵里又只有右侧耳机能使，左边依然连不上没声音（而且按耳机按键也没有声音反馈了）。\n今天去了趟 apple 授权经销商（本地没有官方直营店），店员先看了下充电盒和我说有腐蚀痕迹，然后拿电脑测了一下和我说两边耳机都是充电有问题，和我说只能换耳机，一只 800 （已经过保了）。因为她测出来两边都有问题，所以如果我换的话要两只都换，收 1600 。\n另外今天也看了下极客吧（先看评测一直和他们合作来着，感觉应该还靠谱？）的苹果耳机服务，这里换一只耳机只要 410 。\n想请教各位老哥的问题：\n1.只能换耳机解决吗？毕竟弹窗动画能显示两只耳机和电量，感觉像是软件问题。\n2.如果换耳机的话，为什么像极客吧这样的第三方会便宜不少，有坑吗？\n3.现在的情况是走官方换耳机、走第三方还是直接买新？还有没有别的方式会相对兼顾低成本和省心？",
