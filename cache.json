          "description": "GPT-4 正式发布的日子越来越近了。官方信息、当前趋势、未来预测，都在这里。\n\n\nGPT-3 首度亮相于大约两年之前的 2020 年 5 月，当时正值 GPT-2 发布的一年之后。而 GPT-2 距离最初 GPT 研究论文的发表也是相隔一年。如果这种周期性趋势继续保持不变，那 GPT-4 肯定也快跟大家见面了。但 OpenAI 公司 CEO Sam Altman 几个月前已经打过预防针，表示 GPT-4 预计会在 2022 年年内推出，具体可能是在 7 月到 8 月左右。\n\n虽然备受瞩目，但 GPT-4 目前的公开消息确实相当有限：它会是什么样子、带来怎样的特性或能力，一概不知。Altman 去年曾在一场问答中谈到过 OpenAI 对于 GPT-4 项目的规划，但同时也提醒与会者尽量保持冷静、不要过度乐观。如今七个月已经过去，咱们可以回头看看他的发言了。Altman 首先确认，GPT-4 的参数量不会达到 100 万亿，毕竟规模真到那个程度、今年年内也就不用指望了。\n\nOpenAI 很有一段时间没聊过 GPT-4 的事了，但结合 AI 领域、特别是 NLP 领域获得高度关注的热门趋势，我们倒是可以推断一下 GPT-4 的开发思路。考虑到这些方法大获成功、OpenAI 又都有参与其中，咱们可以从 Altman 的发言中整理出点线索。先说结论：我觉得 GPT-4 不会继续走模型越来越大的老路。\n\n下面来看关于 GPT-4 的具体预测。\n模型大小：GPT-4 不会走越来越大的老路\n\nGPT-4 不会在规模上刷新语言模型的新纪录。Altman 提到 GPT-4 不会比 GPT-3 大多少。虽然跟前几代神经网络相比，GPT-4 肯定也不算小，但其发展思路应该有所改变。我猜 GPT-4 可能介于 GPT-3 和 Gopher（1750 亿到 2800 亿参数）之间。\n点击查看原文>",
