          "description": "conge: \n原文在自己的博客上，地址 https://conge.github.io/2022/04/23/NewDaddy-tea-time/\n自然醒\n周六的好处，就是家里每个人都可以睡到自然醒。\n这不是说周末是睡懒觉的时候哦。\n我最近在训练自己，不用闹钟也能起床。我的闹钟是 4:45 ，常常吧妻子也吵醒了，然后她就会说，自己被吵着睡不好。\n于是，我没开闹钟。\n结果，我 4 点 15 就醒了。妻子呢，6 点半左右醒了。\n我俩都比平时还早。 我问她是不是自然醒的，还是又被我吵到了。\n她说，是自然醒的。但是——还是感觉没睡好\n啊……我好无奈呀！\n孩子们则比平时起得晚了些。但也没晚多少：平时 7 点起床，今天 7 点半也就醒了。至少不是被我叫起来的，这是习惯的力量。\n他们自己醒了，去跟妈妈腻歪一会儿，然后就喊饿。\n西班牙煎蛋\n周末的时候，比较从容，可以做一些相对较慢的吃食。\n孩子们的早餐，我们还是每天都要做的。不过，上学日子的早餐，在顾及营养的同时，还要讲究个“快”字。毕竟，除了早餐，还得准备午餐，打理书包，督促着孩子洗脸梳头刷牙洗脸穿衣戴帽，最后准时送到学校，不快就得迟到。\n自从我也开始轻断食（ intermittent fasting ）开始，我和妻子就不再吃早餐了。于是省出了给自己弄早饭的时间，早上的时间宽裕了一些。但早上的节奏，仍然紧凑。\n于是，西班牙煎蛋这样的吃食，是上学的日子里，我们没有心情做的。\n因为做西班牙煎蛋，是要求煎蛋的人一直不能离开，直到做熟。如此，便没法子“多线程多任务”的与其他准备工作一起做。\n但周末就可以做。\n西班牙煎蛋，与普通的煎蛋的区别，在于必须时刻控制火候，用油也比较多。\n做法如下：\n用一个小的平底锅，一次能煎一到两个但的那种就行。放橄榄油，多放些。\n开中火热油。油温到大概 3 ，4 成就行，打入鸡蛋。\n然后，调小火，保持油温。\n鸡蛋上撒一…",

          "description": "MiketsuSmasher: \n原文： https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/504899532\n也许你 Terminal 用的很 6 ，你喜欢终端超过 GUI ，但今天我来说，Terminal 就是计算机历史上的糟粕产物，你们绝大多数程序员都忽略了 Terminal 几个极其令人无语的缺陷。\n不管是 Gnome Terminal 还是 Windows Terminal ，两个操作系统的 Terminal 都十分落后于时代。\nTerminal 为了支持 Vim 这种程序不得不将自己限定在一种代码环境。\n什么叫代码环境？大家知道代码是什么样子的，统一的字体家族，统一的字体大小。\n所以 Terminal 最大的缺陷就是它同时只能支持一种字体家族和字体大小，这就很蹩脚。\n不管你 Terminal 做的再好，只要你选择支持 Vim 这种程序，就会被限定在统一字体样式的代码环境，就会单调乏味且枯燥。\n代码是统一字体样式的环境，这对于编辑代码来说是好的，但对输出信息来说却不是。\n你输命令的时候，你肯定希望字体样式一模一样，这样方便辨认命令。\n但是在应用程序输出结果的时候，如果只能限定为一种字体样式是不是太死板了？\n就为了支持 Vim 这种遗留产物却要将 Terminal 弄的功能如此弱小？\n我宣布提出下一代 Terminal 的改进思路，我们需要把输入层和输出层严格分离。\n所谓的严格分离是指什么意思？大家知道现在的输入输出信息都是混在一起的。\n如果说我在开启 Terminal 的时候同时构建两个窗口，窗口 1 专门用来输入命令，窗口 2 专门用来展示命令调用的结果。这样窗口 2 就可以不必被限定为一种字体样式，试想一下如果窗口 2 变成了类似于 QQ 的聊天窗口，字体大小可以随便调节，背景随便调节，甚至还可以添加类似于 QQ 气泡的特效，还可以输出图片，这样的窗口 2 不比现在的 Terminal 强成百上千倍？这才是我心目中功能强大的 Terminal 。\n大家都知道 QQ 聊天有聊天记录的功能，这能记录用户的历史输出信息，Terminal 现在的缺陷是什么？你命令输完了，然后按下 clear ，所有过去的命令记录都没了，你连你之前执行了什么操作都查不到，这就导致 Terminal 极其难用。所以我希望构建一个命令日志系统，至少能记录过去一百次的操作都使用了哪些命令，并产生了什么结果，都记录在档案，这样开发者不就能随时翻阅了吗？\n窗口 1 作为输入窗口沿用目前 Windows Terminal 的特性是十分合适的，但一定要构建一个窗口 2 作为视图层专门展示输出的结果，这就是我对 Terminal 未来的一些想象。\n虽然码农不需要 GUI ，但我们需要多样化的输出样式。This the fashion. This is my style.",

          "description": "背景\n一直以来，大一统还是碎片化，是数据库发展趋势的两种最主流预测。随着数字化进程的推进，单一场景无法满足应用多样化的需求，数据库碎片化已呈不可逆的趋势。在当前，市场占有率最高的商用数据库—— Oracle 并没有明显短板的情况下，各种全新的数据库依旧如雨后春笋般层出不穷。如今，DB-Engines 上已有超过 300 余种数据库参与排名。\n \n应用场景的不断扩张，加速了数据库碎片化的进程，数据库的架构、协议、功能、适用场景也愈加多样化。在数据库架构方面，基于单机系统演进而来的集中式数据库与原生面向分布式的新一代数据库并存；在数据库协议方面，MySQL 和 PosrtgreSQL 这两大主要开源生态以及周边厂商所提供的服务生态也在全球数据库体系中各自占有一席之地；每种数据库的独特功能和适用场景，也在相关的领域大放异彩。\n\n在企业的应用现状中，数据库的多元并存已是常态。在互联网行业中，以MySQL + 数据分片中间件作为核心业务存储的架构模式为主，以 GreenPlum、HBase、Elasticsearch、Clickhouse 等其他大数据生态作为分析型数据的计算引擎为辅助。与此同时，一些遗留系统（如：通过 .NET 转型时遗留的 SQLServer、或通过外采而遗留的 Oracle）的数据库仍在运行；在金融行业中，核心交易系统仍然大量使用 Oracle 或  DB2，新业务向 MySQL 或 PostgreSQL 迁移，部分业务则逐渐尝试使用自主研发的数据库。除了交易型数据库，分析型数据库的种类则更加繁多。\n \n因此，碎片化是数据库领域的大势所趋，单一品类的数据库无法适用于所有场景，只能适用于某一种或某几种擅长的场景。\n数据库碎片化带来的问题\n随着企业采用的数据库种类不断增加，各种问题和痛点也随之出现。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "软件架构在敏捷社区中存在争议。在许多人的经验中，架构只会导致毫无价值的会议和无关紧要的文件，“地图不是领土”的说法可以恰当地概括这一观点。然而，架构不佳的应用程序很快就会变得像被遗弃在路边的车辆一样，破损且无法修复。那么，在毫无意义的两极之间是否有一个有用的中间地带呢？\n \n产生这个问题的一部分原因是，对于软件系统架构工作的成果来说，建筑设计是一个不恰当的比喻。对照建筑设计师的工作，这个词会让人联想到预示着乌托邦式美好未来的设计。但是，软件系统的架构远比建筑架构更富于变化。建筑物是静态的，建筑设计师的工作只做一次。软件，就其本质而言，是不断变化的、动态的；当它停止变化时，就开始走向死亡了。\n \n为了更好地理解软件架构，我们有必要追溯下建筑师（architect）这个词的起源。它来自于古希腊词arkitekton，即ἀρχι-（arkhi-，“chief”）+ τέκτων（téktōn，“builder”）。建筑是由建造东西的人创造的。在建筑设计师的工作中，这种意义已经消失了。他们中的许多人从未浇筑过地基，也没有为建筑物搭过框架，更没有安装过水管或暖气管。设计和建造已经被分开了。但在软件领域却不是这样，构建方式会影响到构建内容，反之亦然。\n软件架构关乎决策，而非结构\n以建筑物作类比导致一些软件架构师过于关注结构和行为，而不是产生这些结构和行为的决策。这并不是说结构和行为不重要，而是它们是思想过程的结果。如果系统要随着时间的推移持续演进，就必须保留这个思想过程。知道某人为什么做某事与知道他们做了什么同样重要。如果代码组织得很好并且有注释的话，那么它们所做的事情应该很容易从代码中看出来，但是为什么要这样做却常常被忽略。\n \n其原因是，软件的架构决策很少是一目了然的；几乎每一个架构决策都是在相互竞争的备选方案之间做出妥协。而且，有一些备选方案，如果你不尝试一下，看看它们是如何工作的，就很难看出它们的优点。知道试过什么，放弃了什么，往往比知道什么有效更有价值。有句老话说得好，好的判断来自于经验，而大部分的经验来自于坏的判断。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "4月26日，谷歌提议将Istio捐赠给CNCF的想法得到了社区众多开发者的关注和支持。值得注意的是，两年前，Istio 社区官方博客曾发文称把 Istio 项目商标的所有权转让给Open Usage Commons组织，根据其使用规则，该商标仍可供社区使用。\n谷歌提议Istio加入 CNCF\n \nIstio是一个开源服务网格，提供了统一、高效和透明的方式来保护、连接和监控云原生应用程序中的服务。支持零信任网络、策略执行、流量管理、负载均衡和监控，且所有这些都不需要重写应用程序。Istio 扩展了 Kubernetes，以利用 Envoy 服务代理建立一个可配置的、应用感知的网络，可以管理云原生和传统工作负载，支持从单集群到复杂的多网络部署。\n \n诞生至今，Istio受到了广大开发者的欢迎，并在众多企业内部进行了落地。\n\n此时做出这一决定，谷歌方面表示：Istio 正在迈出这一步，这是一个成熟的项目，即将迎来它的 5 岁生日。在这个阶段，它已经成熟，可以成为更广泛地采用云原生模型和生态系统的主要驱动力。\n \n随着 Knative 作为 CNCF 的孵化项目被接受，谷歌方面认为现在是加入中立的供应组织以进一步推动社区驱动创新的理想时机。这包括 Istio 商标的所有权，该商标将转让给 Linux 基金会。根据 Open Usage Commons发布的使用指南，该商标仍可供社区使用。\n \n\nIstio 站在多个 CNCF 项目的肩膀上，例如 Kubernetes、Envoy、gRPC、Prometheus 和 SPIFFE，并且 Istio 社区的许多贡献者也积极参与了这些项目。它可以与 Helm 一起安装，并且集成了许多其他 CNCF 项目，包括 Knative、Flagger、Jaeger、Open Policy Agent 和 OpenTelemetry。我们认为将 Istio 引入 CNCF 将有助于加快 Istio 及其合作伙伴项目的反馈、功能和开发周期。\n点击查看原文>",
