          "description": "为什么大多数公司最好要避免使用微服务呢？微服务看起来是一种很好的解决方案。从理论上讲，微服务可以加快开发速度，同时允许你独立扩展应用程序的不同部分。但在现实中，微服务是有隐藏成本的。也就是说，我认为，在没有亲自构建微服务之前，你不可能理解它们有多复杂。\n\n下面是我在构建微服务（有时是失败的）时所学到的经验心得。\n管理数据是一场噩梦\n\n保持微服务间的数据同步可能是一项挑战。\n\n每个微服务都有一个数据库，这是推荐的模式。它允许松散的耦合，并且可以让特定服务团队在无需放慢速度协作共享代码的情况下，独立地工作。但如果本应同步启动的微服务中的一个出现故障时，会发生什么呢？比如，其中一个微服务更新了其数据库，而另外一个却没有。这种情形会导致数据不一致。\n\n根据个人的经验，调查跨服务的数据不一致会非常痛苦。错误的跨服务性质需要一个人在不同的服务中工作来修正错误。遗憾的是，这就导致了微服务的优势，即专门针对团队的服务，无法发挥作用。\n\n在一个单体应用中，只要把两个数据库调用合并到一个原子事务中，就能很容易地避免这种情况，因此，所有的插入都会成功，或者都不会成功。非常的简单。但是，松散的藕合会使微服务变得更为难以实现。\n设置时间更长\n\n构建一个微服务架构所花费的时间要比将相同的特性整合到一个单体应用中要多得多。尽管单个服务是非常简单的，但是交互的服务集合要远比单一的单体更加复杂。在一个单体中，一个函数可以调用任何其他公共函数。但是，微服务中的函数仅限于调用同一个微服务中的函数。这就需要服务之间的通信。构建 API 或者消息传递来促进这一点并不容易。而且，跨微服务的代码重复也是不可避免的。当一个单体应用可以一次定义一个模块并多次导入，而微服务是它自己的应用：在每一个模块都必须定义模块和库。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "有些人可能会觉得“数据科学”和“机器学习”这两个术语看起来很高大上，觉得需要很专业的技能才能在这两个领域取得成就。乍一看，数据科学和机器学习的领域可能会让人不知所措，新手眼巴巴望着无穷无尽的代码和技术术语，不知道从哪里入门。\n\nKaggle是许多人在这一领域探索的起点之一。对于其他人来说，Kaggle是他们在机器学习行业参与竞赛、赢得声誉和深入研究的去处。\n\n在本文中，我将带你了解我如何在14岁时成为一名最年轻的Kaggle竞赛大师。\n\n\n\n作者的Kaggle主页\n自我介绍\n我是AndyWang，一名高中新生，对数学、人工智能和计算机科学有着浓厚的兴趣。我在Kaggle上参与竞赛以学习和提高我的技能，并获得了2枚银牌和1枚金牌。\n点击查看原文>",
