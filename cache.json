          "description": "近年来，业务架构越来越受重视，为什么呢？\n\n因为所有技术最终都是面向业务的。\n\n“随着场景个性化变多，业务复杂度也在增加。分布式能解决高并发，云原生也降低了技术难度。那么，如果要把事情做正确，可能还需要自动向下，做业务分析，建议业务模型，做业务架构。”有赞首席架构师万小辉（祝幽）曾这样说到。\n\n或许正因如此，每一届 QCon 全球软件开发大会上，与业务架构相关的专场都异常火爆。大家都期待着，业务架构的发展可以带来新的革命，创造新的业务模式，把更多的不可能变成现实。\n\n将于 5 月 12-14 日举办的 QCon 北京站，我们再度策划了「业务架构」专题。与以往不同的是，这次我们将讨论具有特色或特殊的业务场景中，架构师如何对业务进行抽象、分析，并且设计与之匹配的业务架构。\n\n此次，我们邀请了阿里巴巴文娱移动技术负责人、阿里影业技术负责人田径杯（嗷啸）担任专题出品人。在沟通专题方向与内容设置时，嗷啸认为，好的业务架构需要从业务特性、团队组织架构、当前技术能力等多个角度综合考虑，设计出贴合业务需要，并且能够为业务发展赋能的整体性技术方案。\n\n\n\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "家里WIFI如果发生故障，检查下路由器基本就能发现原因。但对于拥有复杂架构的云计算平台来说，要找出故障原因极为复杂和耗时。阿里打造出根因分析通用框架，利用AI快速定位故障根因，已应用于部分云计算产品，节省时间超过一半，准确率超过80%。该框架也在近期举办的ICASSP’22 AIOps Challenge网络智能运维国际竞赛中获得冠军。\n \nICASSP（International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing）是信号处理领域规模最大的国际学术会议。其中，ICASSP’22 AIOps Challenge网络智能运维竞赛由香港中文大学（深圳）等机构主办，希望用机器学习等方式来自动找出网络故障的根本原因，此次共有382支队伍参赛。由阿里达摩院决策智能实验室和阿里云计算平台组成的团队获得冠军，并受主办方之邀将其中主要算法以论文的形式发表在ICASSP上。\n \n\n阿里团队MindOps获得竞赛冠军\n \n所谓根因分析（Root Cause Analysis），是指找到故障的根本原因，这是智能运维AIOps的重要研究方向。以云计算平台为例，其稳定性至关重要，但由于架构复杂，模块众多，一旦出现故障，如果纯靠人工来排查费时费力，已难以满足需求。因此，基于机器学习等智能方式的根因分析应运而生。\n \n不过，根因分析的技术门槛颇高，挑战重重。首先是运维数据往往来源于不同系统，形式多样，需要大海捞针找出关键信息。其次是容易被表象迷惑，大型系统中，故障传播的链路往往很长，根本原因可能隐藏在深层次节点中。此外还存在标注样本数据少，异常少见等问题。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "重新认识可观测性\n\n管理学大师彼得德鲁克有一句话：“如果你无法衡量它，你就无法管理它”。在企业中，无论是管理人，还是管理事，抑或是管理系统，首先都需要衡量。衡量的过程其实是搜集信息的过程，有了足够的信息才能做出正确的判断，有了正确的判断才能做出有效的管理和行动方案。\n\n下面我用一个简单模型来说明我对可观测性的理解：\n\n\n\n可观测性描述的就是“观测-判断-优化-再观测”这个闭环的连续性、高效性。如果只有观测而无法基于观测做出判断，则不能称其具备可观测性。如果只有经验判断而没有数据支撑，也不能称其具备可观测性，这样会导致组织高度依赖个人能力而带来管理风险。如果优化之后无法反馈到观测上，或者因优化引入新的技术而导致无法观测，则其可观测性不可持续。如果在观测、判断、优化的闭环中需要付出很高的成本和承担很大风险，则其可观测性的价值为负。\n\n所以，当我们在谈可观测性的时候，其实更多考虑的是观测者、管理者的感受，也就是说在我们遇到问题的时候，能否轻而易举地在观测平台找到答案，没有阻力也没有困惑，这就是可观测性。随着企业的发展，组织架构（角色、观测者）和管理对象（系统、被观测者）都会随之发展变化，当使用了一堆传统的观测工具，却仍然无法满足观测者、管理者新的需求的时候，我们不禁要问：“可观测性何在？”。\n“可观测”不等于“可观测性”\n\n下面，我们来看一下我们习以为常的观测方式。\n\n\n\n点击查看原文>",
