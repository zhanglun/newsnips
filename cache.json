          "description": "ojh: \n今天有个帖子是说 Java 笨重、Spring 框架笨重，看完了总结了“笨重”的几点\n内存占用多\nJRE 很大\n配置很复杂\n依赖很多包，打包出来很大（ Srping/SpringBoot ）\n内存占用多\n这个无可厚非，毕竟运行在虚拟机上。但是之前看过一篇博客对比了 Quarkus （印象中） JIT 和 AOT 两种模式下运行内存的占用，启动初期 AOT 完胜 JIT ，但是高负载情况下两者差不多，所以我想了解下是如果同等高负载的情况下，C++/Go 这类的服务端程序的内存占用跟 Java （最新） 比差距大不大呢。\nJRE 很大\n这个如果在最新 Java 下面用 jlink 并且压缩一下应该 50MB （包含 JavaFX 了，不包含的没试过） 左右，一个带 JRE 的 Java 应用 50MB 应该还可以接受吧。其实我疑惑的是很多人吐槽 JRE 大，没人吐槽 NodeJS 或者 Python 大么\n配置很复杂\n估计指的是 Servlet 那套 web.xml 配置以及远古时代 Spring 的 context.xml ，这个我也想吐槽，不过 SpringBoot 应该缓解了这个问题\n打出来的包很大\nSrping/SpringBoot 为了方便开发提供了很多大而全的东西所以很大，如果你的程序就简单的接口，业务代码也很简单，什么依赖注入、切面、请求体转换、参数校验等等功能都用不到，那也没必要用 Spring 框架。顺便问一句有什么好 Java Web 框架脱离 Servlet 体系又很瘦小的\n其实对于我这个 Java 菜鸡来说上面问题都不是让我郁闷的，真正让我郁闷的是 Java 为什么这么多规范！这么多规范真的好吗？\nServlet 规范，大环境下啥时候可以脱离这玩意啊\nGetter 、Setter 方法，我见了很多类的 Getter 、Setter 根本就没什么逻辑在里面，为什么不直接 Public 呢？\n面向接口编程，特别 Spring 开发模式，很多 xxxService/xxxServiceImpl ，经常要改变实现类？我没见过要改的。这种规范搞到一个简单的请求处理分了好几层，写得贼难受，但是公司项目就这样必须做到统一",
