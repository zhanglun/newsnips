          "description": "本文最初发表于 Wave 官网，经原作者 Dan Luu 授权，InfoQ 中文站翻译并分享。\n \nWave 是一家价值 17 亿美元的公司，拥有 70 名工程师，该公司的产品是一款加减数字的 CRUD 应用程序。为了与此保持一致，我们的架构是一种标准的 CRUD 应用架构，基于 Postgres 的 Python 单体架构。先从一个简单的架构入手，然后尽量用最简单的方式来解决问题，这使得我们的业务范围能够扩大到这种规模，而工程师们大多专注于为用户提供价值的工作。\n \nStackoverflow 扩大了单体的规模，取得了良好的效果（2013 年的架构/2016 年的架构），最后以 18 亿美元的价格被收购。如果我们关注的是流量而非市场市值，那么 Stackoverflow 就是互联网上流量最高的前 100 个网站之一（关于其他许多建立在单体之上的有价值的公司的案例，请参考这条 Twitter 主题的回复。我们没有很多网络流量，因为我们是一个移动应用，但 Alexa 还是将我们的网站列在了前 75000 名，尽管我们的网站基本上只是人们查找 APP 的一种途径，而大部分人并没有从我们的网站中获得这些 APP）。\n \n有些应用的要求，使得在一个枯燥的数据库中构建出一个简单的单体应用是不可能的，但对大部分应用来说，即便是在前 100 个网站的流量水平上，计算机的运行速度也足以满足使用简单的架构来提供服务，通常创建简单的架构比复杂的架构更便宜、更容易。\n \n尽管简单的架构具有不合理的有效性，但是大部分的新闻报道都是围绕着复杂的架构展开的。举例来说，在最新的通用技术会议上，就有六场演讲讨论了怎样构建或处理基于微服务的复杂结构的负面影响，却没有一场演讲讨论如何构建简单的单体。甚至关于量子计算的演讲也有一场。更大规模的会议也一样；最近旧金山的一次以企业为导向的会议上，关于处理复杂架构的演讲，场次就高达两位数；却没有一场关于如何构建简单的单体的演讲。我上次去的那次会议给我留下了很深的印象，就是许多公司的员工，他们的应用程序规模很小，本来可以用简单的架构就能完成，但是他们使用的都是会议圈子和网络上流行的最新、最复杂的技术。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "发展到现在，数据湖越来越受企业重视，美国知名科技企业风投机构A16Z经过调查发现数据湖已成为现代化数据分析架构中的中流砥柱，处于数据分析架构的核心位置。HDFS和对象存储都是可以用来构建数据湖的组件，但对象存储更能适应当前存算分离的发展趋势，所以越来越多的企业转向了对象存储，阿里的数据湖在2019年也从Hadoop生态转向了对象存储OSS。\n \n其实对象存储并不是一个新生事物，具有20多年的发展历史，那么这些年它有什么样的演变？在适应数据湖的过程中，又有哪些需要改进的地方呢？未来有什么样的发展趋势？为解答这些问题，InfoQ采访了阿里云对象存储负责人罗庆超。\n \n采访嘉宾简介：罗庆超，阿里巴巴资深技术专家，阿里云对象存储负责人，在企业存储和云存储领域有丰富的技术与产品经验。曾就职于世界 500 强以及知名跨国公司的存储团队，负责过高端存储阵列的数据路径架构设计和开发，作为海量存储首席架构师负责文件存储、对象存储以及下一代分布式云存储的架构设计和实现，同时在灾备以及数据管理领域亦有多年开发和运维经验。带领技术研发团队，多次在大规模商业项目中成功落地。毕业于电子科技大学计算机系统结构专业，并获得硕士学位，在相关技术研究领域，支持并参与多本行业专业书籍的编写工作，被授予包括块存储、文件存储、对象存储、数据湖等方向30多项发明专利，技术成果成功应用到产品创新迭代。《对象存储实战指南》图书作者。QCon上海2021“明星讲师”，QCon北京2022“数据湖存储底座”专题出品人。\n \nInfoQ：您在存储行业工作多年，对象存储从90年代就开始出现了，是否能解释下这些年对象存储技术的主要演变？\n \n罗庆超：对象存储并非近期出现的新技术，它具有 20 多年的历史，大致可以分为 3 个阶段：\n点击查看原文>",
