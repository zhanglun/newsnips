          "description": "guangyaomiao: \n大家好，我最近发布了职级对标新一版的天梯图 网站链接 https://duibiao.info，这个天梯图使用了量化模型来建构各个公司的职级对标图。现在迫不及待的想跟大家分享一下我是怎么用网站里的薪酬数据生成这个图的：\n\n在解答如何使用已有的薪酬数据生成天梯图之前，我们先说明一下我们理想中的天梯图是怎么定义的：\n天梯图是公司职级从低到高，根据每个职级的薪酬，工作经验等数据，确定每个职级在一维映射中的范围。\n说起来似乎有点抽象，但其实就是确定每个职级在天梯图中的高度。然后把每个公司的职级从上到下一个一个接起来就好了。\n那么问题来了，我们怎么确定各个公司每一个职级的高度呢？以前我们是自己在网上看大家的讨论，得到一个感性的认识来画出每个职级。现在我们有每个职级的薪酬数据，那我们就可以通过模型把职级映射到天梯图上。如果我们通过机器学习的方法来完成这个模型.\n则我们的输入是薪酬，模型是某一种机器学习的模型，输出就是一维映射的数值。并且这个数值可以代表职级高低。大概是这样：\n\n好，我们现在有了方向，我们细化一下步骤：\n第一步：我们利用用户匿名提交的薪酬数据作为训练数据集的来源: 我们设计一个基于神经网络的分类模型，并将其中某一层向量维度设计为(?, 1)，其中 1 这个一位的向量的数值就可以当成是这个职级的高度。那从输入开始的第一层至这一层，我们称为 encoder 。我们用此模型去对匿名用户的薪酬数据进行分类预测，以期能准确预测用户的职级。我们以此为模型训练的基本逻辑。\n根据这个思路，我们建立了一个 4 层的神经网络来训练我们的模型，神经网络的输入是薪酬，工龄，司龄，学位，输出是一个浮点数，代表这个薪酬在薪酬表中的位置：\n\n其中第 0 到第 8 层，就是 encoder ， 而最后一层是这个薪酬数据在从 junior 到 senior 各个职级的可能性（最后一层仅用于训练，薪酬有人工标注的职级）。\n第二步：当训练完成后，取模型的 encoder 部分，取某一个公司、某一类工作的所有数据输入至 encoder ，则能获得一维数值映射的点阵图。下图的横轴为 encoder 的 output ，数值越低的数据点往往意味着职级较低，而数值越高的数据点则意味着职级较高。由此，我们的模型可以把不同的职级的数据尽可能的区分开。​\n\n最后一步，为了得到最终的天梯图，只需按照职级将每个数据放入 encoder ，并得到 output 。然后进行统计归类，得到职级与职级间 encoder output 的边界。如阿里巴巴有 P5 到 P9 五个职级，我们把 encoder output 按照其职级分为五组之后得到五个 boxplot 。职级之间的边界，可以理解为相邻两个 boxplot 的中间点。\n\n可以看出，这个图离阿里的职级图其实就很接近了，我们只需要把它”垒“起来即可。\n最终将以上方法推而广之，即可获得每个公司的动态天梯图。考虑到所有的薪酬数据都采用同一个 encoder 进行预处理，那么所有的公司职级天梯本质上是共用了同一套坐标轴（参考系）。\n这就是我们画出职级对标天梯图的基本步骤。特别感谢团队中的孙嘉隽同学。是由他从头到尾把算法跑通并工程实现了整个项目。\n如果大家感兴趣，请添加我们的微信群，欢迎大家来交流。",

          "description": "在MWC2022 巴塞罗那世界移动大会期间，以“释放联接潜力，加速数字经济发展”为主题的IPv6论坛举行。华为数据通信产品线副总裁赵志鹏发表了“IPv6+，数字化转型基石”的主题演讲，与产业各界共同展望IPv6+的未来。\n \n赵志鹏指出，数字化的快速发展对IP网络提出了新的需求，IP网络是数字化发展的基石。首先是海量物联的需求，预计到2030年，全球物联规模将达到百亿级别，支持海量接入将成为IP网络的重要基础能力；同时云时代的到来，更多企业选择多云的连接，对网络的实时性和灵活性带来了挑战；面向未来，不仅是办公业务上云，越来越多的生产业务也会向云端迁移，这对网络的确定性提出了更高的要求。“面对这些新需求，IPv6+在确定性、可编程性、智能运维等方面的创新，将进一步释放联接的价值。”\n \n据悉，IPv6是互联网协议第6版，是互联网工程任务组（IETF）设计的用于替代IPv4的下一代IP协议。由于IPv4地址不足的问题，已经严重制约了互联网的应用和发展，IPv6的使用解决网络地址资源数量的问题，“可以给地球上的每粒沙子都分配一个IP地址”。\n \n而IPv6+是IPv6的增强创新，是对基于IPv6的网络能力全面升级，在2020年8月ETSI（欧洲电信标准协会）发布的IPv6白皮书中，ETSI认为，IPv6+包括了基于IPv6的协议创新，并把IPv6和AI结合起来。以SRv6等协议创新为代表，结合网络分析、智能调优等网络智能创新技术，实现智能路径规划、业务快速部署、运维自动化、质量可视化、SLA保障、应用感知等。在2021年8月ETSI发布的Gap Analysis报告中，ETSI进一步总结道，IPv6+从超宽、广联接、确定性、低时延、自动化和安全六个维度全面提升IP网络能力。\n \n赵志鹏提到，从人人互联到万物互联，IPv6+已经在全球实现了100+的商用。那么，具体到千行百业的数字化转型过程中，IPv6+是如何发挥作用的？\n点击查看原文>",
