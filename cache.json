          "description": "去年 7 月，微软联合 GitHub、OpenAI 打造了一个全新的代码生成 AI——GitHub Copilot，其背后的功臣正是 OpenAI 深度学习驱动平台 Codex。不过，数据显示，Codex 的准确率大概有 30%。日前，微软推出AI代码审查工具 Jigsaw，进一步提升 AI 编码的准确率。\n\n\n目前，各类可调大型预训练语言模型（包括GPT-3、Codex等）已经能够根据程序员用自然语言表达的意图，成功编写出代码。这类自动化模型当然有望提升每一位软件开发从业者的生产效率，但也由于模型自身难以理解程序语义，因此尚无法保证生成代码的最终质量。\n\n在我们的研究论文《Jigsaw：当大型语言模型牵手程序综合》（Jigsaw: Large Language Models meet Program Synthesis，文章已被国际软件工程会议ICSE 2022接收）中，我们介绍了一种可以提高这类大型语言模型性能的新工具。Jigsaw中包含可以理解程序语法及语义的后处理技术，可利用用户反馈不断提升修正能力。配合多模输入，Jigsaw即可为Python Pandas API合成代码。\n\n我们的经验表明，随着这些大型语言模型逐步演变为“按意图合成代码”的利器，Jigsaw也将在提高系统准确性方面发挥重要作用。\n机器编写软件的前景与风险\n\n以OpenAI的Codex项目为代表的各类大型语言模型，正在重塑编程领域的整体面貌。软件开发者如今在处理编程任务时，可以直接对所需代码片段的功能做出英文描述，Codex则通过Python或JavaScript等语言合成出预期代码。\n点击查看原文>",
