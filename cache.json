          "description": "conge: \n原文链接： https://conge.github.io/2022/05/17/meditation-env/\n冥想的理想环境\n当你准备开始冥想时，你是否先要寻找一个合适的环境？\n声音不能太大，太吵，太嘈杂。光线不能太明或太暗。周围最好不要有别人。温度最好温暖适宜，椅子最好舒服，可供久坐。要是有熏香，或者蜡烛，或者鲜花，和音乐就更好了。\n或者，你有没有收拾出来一个冥想专用空间，周围摆满你喜欢的物品，能给你带来积极情绪。\n或者，你总要先要收拾一下你的桌面，椅子，屋子，确保一切整洁，干净，井井有条……\n你的理想环境是怎样的呢？\n平静，安宁，芳香，美好，秩序，洁净，神圣， 这曾是我所向往的冥想之地的样子。\n我的现实\n我在家办公，有一个专门的办公桌，但没有专门的空间。办公桌放在客厅，紧邻厨房。\n虽说办公桌是“我的”，但我的女儿经常会拿着她的笔，颜料，本子，纸张，在我的桌上来画画。儿子，则想方设法的往我的怀里钻。孩子们在家的的时候，是我尤其能对安静产生感恩的时候。\n我经常在办公桌前的冥想。但你可以想象，孩子们在家的时候，不受打扰是怎样的一种奢望。\n有那么一次，我刚开始冥想，不到五岁的儿子就非要坐在我怀里。那是我平时都只冥想 10 分钟左右的我，第一次想要冥想 30 分钟。\n我告诉他，你可以坐，但爸爸要冥想，你得安静。我心说，你还不坐一会儿就走吗。然后我就静坐观呼吸冥想。\n那个年纪的小孩子，怎么可能安静。他就坐在我怀里，不时扭动一下，要么就自言自语，还唱起歌来。\n我就跟着调整姿态，保证脊背挺直。\n只觉得时间过了一会儿，他起身走了。\n没想到他刚离开，30 分钟就到了…都没想到时间过得这么快\n事后讲给妻子听。儿子说，“我也冥想了…”。\n有时我会去厨房躲清净，在那里冥想。我又会被食物的味道所包围，冰箱的制冷时不时的启动一下。而且，孩子们还是回来找你。\n出门，路上会有汽车。会有邻居打招呼。但我也在自家楼前冥想过。不远处的高速路上车流不断鸿鸣不止。偶尔有人走过，开门关门。\n我也在工作单位冥想过。耳边是别人打电话的声音，敲键盘的声音，走动的声音，谈话的声音。\n理想中的冥想的地方或许存在，或者说，我希望并相信它一定存在。可在现实中，我从来没有遇到过。\n现实其实比理想要好\n但是，不知你看出来没有。我并不是在抱怨。\n能在孩子面前冥想，不但是自己的修炼，也是给他们树立一个榜样。他们对冥想的认识，是从我开始。而且，他们虽然吵闹，但是，看到我冥想的时候，也会主动“降噪”，不会过分吵闹。\n况且，理想的冥想环境，未必就真的有利于冥想练习。\n有人说“良好的环境是没有任何东西分散你的地方”。我不这么认为。\n我的文章《简单冥想》里说，冥想就是端坐观呼吸，或数呼吸就行。\n可难道冥想就是数数玩儿吗？\n显然不是的。\n冥想练习过程中，人会有许多内在或外在的分心事物出现，把人的心神分散。人们会被事物牵引，忘记数呼吸，或者忘记数到 5 要返回重新开始。然后，忽然回神，想起自己应该数呼吸，于是，心神从分心物上收回。然后心神会再被什么分散，然后又觉察到分神，重新聚拢。整个冥想的过程，就是这样分神回神，不停的反复。\n我们的觉察力正是因为分神回神，才得到锻炼。天长日久，练习多了，我们的觉察就使我们更容易意识到分神，更快的回神。最终，我们能在分心事物刚一出现，就能意识到它们的到来，并且不再被其分心。于是，能观察它们，并且放手。\n所以，我们环境中的那些分心物，那些嘈杂，悸动，变化，浑浊，混乱……并不是我们的敌人，而是我们的对手，陪练。\n就如同练太极时，一个人只能练习拳架，两个人则可以推手。\n把那不太容易冥想的环境，当作你的陪练，跟它们推手吧。它们会让你有更多的练习机会。\n哦，我当然不反对你去寻求适合冥想的环境。对于初学者来说，外界刺激少一些，能使练习更加容易。\n只是，当理想环境不易得时，把环境当作朋友，比当作敌人，更能促进我们的练习。\n至少，放下对环境的执着，能解放你的部分心智，使其能更专注于冥想和生活。\n安全最重要\n现在，我对冥想环境的要求只有一个：安全。\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Faye Cornish on Unsplash\n\n\n\n我近期些的有关冥想的其他文章:\n2022-05-10 Tue. 冥想的根本 \n2022-05-03 Tue. 冥想的时候浑身不得劲\n2022-04-27 Wed. 冥想，从练习坐姿开始 \n2022-04-22 Fri. 冥想与呼吸\n2022-04-15 Fri. 有关简单冥想练习的问答\n2022-04-08 Fri. 简单冥想\n2022-05-17 初稿",

          "description": "近日，字节跳动发布一封内部邮件，官宣开源委员会正式成立，这意味着开源战略在字节跳动的重要程度进一步提升，同时，字节跳动开源将从原来由工程师自发驱动逐步走向有组织的“正规军”。InfoQ第一时间联系并专访了字节跳动开源委员会主要负责人张鑫、王剑，本文将全面解读字节跳动开源委员会如何构建、运作以及未来将朝着什么方向发展。\n为什么要成立开源委员会？\n \n从2015年开源的Rcproxy项目开始，字节在开源层面的贡献已经有了一定积累。这几年间字节陆续向社区开放了多个经过内部业务验证的开源项目，比如现代Web开发框架Modern.js、微服务中间件CloudWeGo、高性能分布式训练框架 BytePS、联邦学习平台Fedleaner等。根据内部调研统计，字节目前已经对外开源了五十多个项目，按照技术领域分类，其中项目数量排在前三的分别是基础架构、AI平台和音视频领域。\n \n与此同时，字节也向社区反哺了多个主流开源项目的新特性。近日，由谷歌开源的应用开发框架Flutter正式发布3.0版本，官方博文中就提到“字节跳动是 Flutter 的主要用户，估计其有约 80 个基于 Flutter 的应用”。除了是主要用户，字节也是Flutter社区的重要参与者，至今为Flutter相关代码仓库贡献的PR超过80个，还开源了Flutter 应用内调试工具 UME。\n \n在很长一段时间里，字节做开源更多还是由工程师的个人兴趣来主要驱动，但过程中其实也遇到了一些问题。2021年10月，抖音前端团队宣布开源其设计系统和 UI 库 Semi Design，随后有网友指出Semi Design的代码中出现了友商同类产品的痕迹，项目陷入“抄袭风波”。虽然抖音前端团队工程师很快发表了致歉声明，但事件已经在开源社区引发热烈讨论。这让字节意识到，开源仅仅靠工程师的兴趣驱动是不够的，还需要引入公司级的策略、规范和流程机制。\n点击查看原文>",
