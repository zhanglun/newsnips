You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "一、背景\nAndroid 开发者在日常的开发中，经常需要用到查看视图的功能，Android Studio 开发团队为我们提供了 LayoutInspector 插件。在较新的版本提供了 LiveLayoutInspector，支持 3D，但是不管是 LayoutInspector 还是 LiveLayoutInspector 都非常难用。比如：\n\n\n速度极慢，遇到复杂的布局经常超时\n\n某些情况无法选中指定的 View\n\n\n本文将围绕 LayoutInspector 的痛点，分析问题并修复，最终将 LayoutInspector 变成一个稳定、好用的插件。\n二、加速 Dump View Hierarchy\n2.1 问题描述\n\n\n开发复杂业务的同学在使用 LayoutInspector 时都遇到过上图所示的错误：由于 View 树结构复杂超时。网上也有其他相关的解决办法，原理就是修改 timeout 的值，目前默认值是 20s，所以改成 1min，大概率是可以的了。\n\n为了更好的解决这个问题，比如是否能加速？我们看一下整个 LayoutInspector 抓取的流程。梳理流程之前，我们需要找到功能的入口。\n点击查看原文>",
