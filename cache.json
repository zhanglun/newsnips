          "description": "最近，AWS发布了一个新的PowerShell自定义运行时，可让AWS Lambda运行使用PowerShell编写的Lambda函数。有了这个运行时，开发人员无需编译就可以用Lambda编写原生PowerShell代码，从而简化了部署和测试。\n\nAWS的无服务器开发者布道师Julian Wood介绍了它的优势：\n\n\n新的PowerShell自定义运行时使用了原生PowerShell，不需要编译PowerShell并托管在.NET运行时上。使用原生PowerShell意味着函数运行时环境与标准的PowerShell会话是匹配的，这简化了开发和测试过程……这个自定义运行时将管道上的所有内容作为函数输出返回，包括Write-Output的输出。开发人员能够更好地控制函数输出、错误消息和日志记录。\n\n\n虽然Lambda从2018年开始就支持PowerShell，但之前的解决方案需要依赖.NET Core运行时，并且一个函数只返回PowerShell管道的最后一次输出。微软MVP、Powershell推广者Justin Grote在推特上写道：\n\n\nAWS Lambda终于有了一个PowerShell运行时，而不是“为PowerShell构建一个C#应用，这就是我们支持PowerShell的方式”。伟大的杰作！\n\n\n\n\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "Akka所属的Lightbend公司最近推出了Kalix，这是一种新的平台即服务（Platform-as-a-Service，Paas）产品，用于使用任何编程语言构建无数据库的云原生业务关键型应用程序。Kalix是一个统一的应用程序层，它将编写软件所需的各个部分组合在一起，并对它们的实现细节进行抽象。Lighbend旨在为开发人员提供“创新的NoOps开发人员体验”。\n \nLightbend的创始人兼首席执行官Jonas Bonér解释了Kalix的动机：\n \n\n云生态系统的复杂性正在减缓工程和开发团队的速度。Kubernetes在管理、编排和确保容器的可用性和可伸缩性方面做得非常出色，但这仅仅是故事的一半。需要对应用程序层进行同等的投资，以使开发人员能更容易地构建完整的应用程序，充分利用我们所拥有的所有优秀的底层云基础设施。Kalix就是这一关键问题的解决方案。\n\n \nKalix旨在为建模和构建有状态或无状态的原生云提供简单的开发人员体验，以及NoOps体验，包含了一个统一的系统设计、部署和操作方式。此外，它还提供了一个“响应式运行时”，声称通过不断优化数据访问、放置、位置和复制，可以提供“超低延迟和高弹性”。\n点击查看原文>",
