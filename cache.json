When there is no dedicated summary (only Atom feed has it, and many sites don't use it) from the source, we check if the content/description (Both Atom and RSS) field is long enough to be full text. If so, it will be truncated into a \"pseudo\" summary. If not, we assume the source used the content field as summary, and it will be displayed in full length.\nThank you: @LooperXX.",

          "description": "在本文中，我将深入探讨 Lambda 的成功之处，我们面临的挑战，以及为什么我们最终会决定将一些服务从 Lambda 迁移到 AWS 弹性容器服务（Elastic Container Service，ECS）。\n\n\n我们要解决的问题是什么？\n\n简单介绍一下背景，我们的产品是 B2B 软件公司的一个集成平台，我们帮助软件公司构建集成，并将这些集成部署给他们的客户。一次简单的集成可能如下所示：\n\n\n步骤一：在 Dropbox 中下拉 XML 文档。\n\n步骤二：使用一些自定义的 JavaScript 代码处理 XML。\n\n步骤三：使用一些存储的凭证，向第三方 API 发布经过处理的数据。\n\n\n用户可以按计划配置集成以运行，也可以通过 webhook 触发集成，而平台则负责运行、记录和监控集成（以及一大堆其他内容）。\n早期情况\n\nPrismatic 的第一个实现使用 LocalStack。我们希望最终把 Prismatic 托管在 AWS 上（根据需要可能会迁移到 Azure、GCP 等），所以需要在本地启动我们的平台来模拟 AWS。类似 AWS Lambda 的 LocalStack 服务易于迭代，并且在运行中不会出现大问题。这为我们提供了一个非常好的开发反馈回路，我们很快进行了原型设计和测试。\n\n在使用 Lambda 执行集成的每一个步骤时，步骤利用 SQS 传递数据并触发下一个步骤。所以，集成的执行情况如下所示：\n点击查看原文>",
