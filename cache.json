          "description": "xuegy: 朋友送我一台弃疗的戴尔 T30 。这台电脑是他看我用 T30 装了一台 NAS 后跟着买的。我的 NAS 已稳定工作 4 年，他买的这台却频繁死机。具体故障表现为：小内存占用一个月也不死机，只要跑内存占用大的东西很快就会无征兆死机。昨天机器拿到手跑了一个 memtest ，直接花屏了。\n\n然后我把内存拆下来擦了擦，稳定地从昨天晚上运行到今天中午，然后又死机了。\n推测故障原因大概就这三种：\n1. Skylake （ E3-1225 v5 ）集成的内存控制器坏了\n2. 主板的内存插槽坏了\n3. 内存条坏了\n有什么办法能够在不花钱买零件的情况下诊断故障原因呢？如果维修成本>$100 我就不修了。",

          "description": "Node.js作为后端框架，自2009年首次发布以来，已被越来越多的公司广泛采用。它的成功有以下几个原因：JavaScript语言(又称Web语言)的应用，一个丰富的开源模块和工具的生态系统，以及它简单高效的原型API。\n\n不幸的是，简单是一把双刃剑。一个简单的Node.js API，随着增长会变得越来越复杂，缺乏软件设计和最佳实践经验的开发人员可能很快就会被软件熵、偶然的复杂性或技术债务所淹没。\n\n此外，JavaScript语言的灵活性很容易被滥用，正常可用的原型在生产环境中跑着跑着就会很快变成不可维护的怪物。在使用Node.js启动一个项目时，很容易会忽视传统上与Java和C#等OOP语言一起使用的最佳实践(例如SOLID原则)，当然，这说不好会更好，还是会更坏。\n\n当我帮助我的客户(大多数是刚起步的公司)改进他们的Node.js代码库时，以及在我编写的开源项目中，我感受到了软件熵的痛苦。例如，在维护10年前开始编写的Node.js应用程序openwhyd.org时，我面临着越来越多的挑战。我经常在客户的Node.js代码库中发现类似的挑战：正在增加的功能会破坏看似不相关的功能，bug变得难以检测和修复，自动化测试编写起来很有挑战性，运行速度慢，而且会因为奇怪的原因失败……\n\n让我们来探究一下为什么有些Node.js代码库比其他的更难测试。并探讨编写简单、健壮和快速检查业务逻辑的测试的几种技术。包括依赖注入(即SOLID的“D”)，认可测试以及（剧透警告）没有模拟（mock）!\n点击查看原文>",
