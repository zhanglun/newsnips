          "description": "在MWC2022 巴塞罗那世界移动大会期间，以“释放联接潜力，加速数字经济发展”为主题的IPv6论坛举行。华为数据通信产品线副总裁赵志鹏发表了“IPv6+，数字化转型基石”的主题演讲，与产业各界共同展望IPv6+的未来。\n \n赵志鹏指出，数字化的快速发展对IP网络提出了新的需求，IP网络是数字化发展的基石。首先是海量物联的需求，预计到2030年，全球物联规模将达到百亿级别，支持海量接入将成为IP网络的重要基础能力；同时云时代的到来，更多企业选择多云的连接，对网络的实时性和灵活性带来了挑战；面向未来，不仅是办公业务上云，越来越多的生产业务也会向云端迁移，这对网络的确定性提出了更高的要求。“面对这些新需求，IPv6+在确定性、可编程性、智能运维等方面的创新，将进一步释放联接的价值。”\n \n据悉，IPv6是互联网协议第6版，是互联网工程任务组（IETF）设计的用于替代IPv4的下一代IP协议。由于IPv4地址不足的问题，已经严重制约了互联网的应用和发展，IPv6的使用解决网络地址资源数量的问题，“可以给地球上的每粒沙子都分配一个IP地址”。\n \n而IPv6+是IPv6的增强创新，是对基于IPv6的网络能力全面升级，在2020年8月ETSI（欧洲电信标准协会）发布的IPv6白皮书中，ETSI认为，IPv6+包括了基于IPv6的协议创新，并把IPv6和AI结合起来。以SRv6等协议创新为代表，结合网络分析、智能调优等网络智能创新技术，实现智能路径规划、业务快速部署、运维自动化、质量可视化、SLA保障、应用感知等。在2021年8月ETSI发布的Gap Analysis报告中，ETSI进一步总结道，IPv6+从超宽、广联接、确定性、低时延、自动化和安全六个维度全面提升IP网络能力。\n \n赵志鹏提到，从人人互联到万物互联，IPv6+已经在全球实现了100+的商用。那么，具体到千行百业的数字化转型过程中，IPv6+是如何发挥作用的？\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "当前的图像修复系统往往需要处理大量缺失的部分，近来，Roman Suvorov 等人提出了一种叫做 LaMa 的 SOTA 技术，能够在给定的图像中屏蔽任意尺度的对象，并返回一个不包括我们所屏蔽物体的修复图像。在本文中，我们将从理论上探讨这种方法，并了解其具体工作原理。\n\n关于图像修复\n\n重建图像中缺失的区域，使得观众不能辨别出哪些区域是否被修复，称为图像修复。这种方法通常用于删除图片中不需要的内容，或者还原老照片的受损部分。\n \n图像修复是一种有数百年历史的技术，是由人类艺术家手工完成的。它涉及填补艺术品的受损、变质或缺失区域，从而创造一幅完整的图像。油画或丙烯酸颜料、化学照片版画、雕塑、数字照片和视频都是可以用于这种方法的物理和数字艺术载体的例子。要解决图像修复问题，逼真地填补缺失的部分，就需要“理解”自然图像的大尺度结构，并对其进行图像合成。\n\n近年来，学者们提出了各种自动化的修复方法。除了图像之外，这些算法中大多数都需要一个蒙版来显示修复区域作为输入。这个主题在深度学习出现之前就已经被研究过，近年来由于深入的、广泛的神经网络以及对抗学习的应用，发展加快了。\n \n修复系统通常在一个庞大的自动生成的数据集上进行训练，该数据集通过随机掩蔽真实图像建立。复杂的两阶段模型结合中间预测，如经常被使用的平滑图像、边缘和图像分割。\n点击查看原文>",
