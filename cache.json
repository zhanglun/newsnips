          "description": "本文最初发表于 Wave 官网，经原作者 Dan Luu 授权，InfoQ 中文站翻译并分享。\n \nWave 是一家价值 17 亿美元的公司，拥有 70 名工程师，该公司的产品是一款加减数字的 CRUD 应用程序。为了与此保持一致，我们的架构是一种标准的 CRUD 应用架构，基于 Postgres 的 Python 单体架构。先从一个简单的架构入手，然后尽量用最简单的方式来解决问题，这使得我们的业务范围能够扩大到这种规模，而工程师们大多专注于为用户提供价值的工作。\n \nStackoverflow 扩大了单体的规模，取得了良好的效果（2013 年的架构/2016 年的架构），最后以 18 亿美元的价格被收购。如果我们关注的是流量而非市场市值，那么 Stackoverflow 就是互联网上流量最高的前 100 个网站之一（关于其他许多建立在单体之上的有价值的公司的案例，请参考这条 Twitter 主题的回复。我们没有很多网络流量，因为我们是一个移动应用，但 Alexa 还是将我们的网站列在了前 75000 名，尽管我们的网站基本上只是人们查找 APP 的一种途径，而大部分人并没有从我们的网站中获得这些 APP）。\n \n有些应用的要求，使得在一个枯燥的数据库中构建出一个简单的单体应用是不可能的，但对大部分应用来说，即便是在前 100 个网站的流量水平上，计算机的运行速度也足以满足使用简单的架构来提供服务，通常创建简单的架构比复杂的架构更便宜、更容易。\n \n尽管简单的架构具有不合理的有效性，但是大部分的新闻报道都是围绕着复杂的架构展开的。举例来说，在最新的通用技术会议上，就有六场演讲讨论了怎样构建或处理基于微服务的复杂结构的负面影响，却没有一场演讲讨论如何构建简单的单体。甚至关于量子计算的演讲也有一场。更大规模的会议也一样；最近旧金山的一次以企业为导向的会议上，关于处理复杂架构的演讲，场次就高达两位数；却没有一场关于如何构建简单的单体的演讲。我上次去的那次会议给我留下了很深的印象，就是许多公司的员工，他们的应用程序规模很小，本来可以用简单的架构就能完成，但是他们使用的都是会议圈子和网络上流行的最新、最复杂的技术。\n点击查看原文>",
