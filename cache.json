          "description": "35岁程序员，廉颇老矣，尚能饭否？\n \n“35岁危机”不仅笼罩在程序员群体头上，可能也是数字化时代人才“蕉绿症”的一个缩影。面对前所未有的新技术快速迭代、数字技术与业务深度融合、企业持续创新与发展的挑战，“21世纪什么最贵？”的问题又会老生常谈。\n \n数字化人才哪里寻？数字化人才如何养成？极客邦副总裁兼“双数”研究院院长付晓岩一语道破：“数字人才的培养要‘有的放矢’，而这个‘的’，就是数字经济，我们要围绕数字经济发展的需求，发掘和培养时代需要的数字人才。”\n \n数字人才培养要有的放矢\n \n“十四五”规划《纲要》中如此定义数字化转型：迎接数字时代，激活数据要素潜能，推进网络强国建设，加快建设数字经济、数字社会、数字政府，以数字化转型整体驱动生产方式、生活方式和治理方式变革。在国家政策的强有力推动下，数字化转型的巨轮正滚滚向前，从高速增长到高质量增长，整体的转型正在重新塑造一个时代，而“数据、网络和（软硬件）工具”将是推动数字化转型的重要抓手。我们要从更加全面、相互联系和系统化的角度看待和推进数字化转型。\n \n那么，基于数字化转型的数字经济又给我们提出了哪些新要求呢？《“十四五”数字经济发展规划》中是这样描述数字经济的：以数据资源为关键要素，以现代信息网络为主要载体，以信息通信技术融合应用、全要素数字化转型为重要推动力，促进公平与效率更加统一的新经济形态。我们不难发现，“数据、网络和（软硬件）工具”这一重要抓手被再次强调；从更深层次看，在实现产业数字化和数字产业化的过程中，平台化既是核心竞争力的体现，也是一种新的商业模式。\n \n数字经济的发展以数字化转型为前提，转型不是喊喊口号，而是要真抓实干，那就需要大量相关的数字化人才。笼统地说，所谓数字化人才就是“掌握数字化工作技能的人才”，具体包括专项技术人才、横向技术架构人才、业务与技术复合型人才、掌握数字化思维的业务人才，以及掌握数字化思维的管理者。数字化人才只有与数字经济的三要素——“数据、网络和工具”充分结合，即掌握和利用数字化工具，高效处理和挖掘数据，并通过网络协作的方式，融入生态，才能有效推动数字化转型，既包括个人职业生涯的转变与提升，也包括推动企业业务的转型与发展，其实是一举两得。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "引言\n\n数字经济是继农业经济、工业经济之后的主要经济形态。在数字经济时代，数据已经被广泛认可为一种企业资产，甚至把数据作为一种新型生产要素，与土地、劳动力、资本、技术等传统要素并列为生产要素之一。土地需要深耕、施肥，改善土壤结构，协调土壤的水、肥、气、热的关系，还要除杂草，防除病虫害，才能培育出高产稳产的肥沃土地。与土地生产要素一样，数据生产要素也需要管理、分析才能创造出价值。\n\n在数字经济时代中，伴随着数据资产、数据要素诞生的首席数据官也在不断崛起。在美国，第一个（2010年）设立首席数据官是科罗拉多州，随后纽约、伊利诺伊州和康涅狄格州也先后设立了首席数据官。在美国联邦政府层面，依据《循证决策法案》2020年成立了联邦CDO委员会用于提升首席数据官能力，领导美国数据战略交付。在学术协会层面，作为首席数据官研究和实践的先驱和领导者Richard Y. Wang教授，自2007年以来一直主持麻省理工学院CDOIQ研讨会，该研讨会旨在提升首席数据官的知识并加速首席数据官在各行各业的采用。在CDOIQ研讨会的孵化下，成立了一个专注于提升数据领导力的专业的国际首席数据官协会（iscdo）。在国内（2021年），广东省率先开展首席数据官试点工作，紧接着深圳市、浙江省、江苏省也开始探索首席数据官的试点工作。\n\n在国外首席数据官在理论、制度、实践开始都较早，而在国内首席数据官也开始成为一个热门话题。但是首席数据官在很多方面，比如政界、企业界、学术界都没有达成统一的共识。比如：CDO的角色和职责是什么？谁是首席数据官最佳人选？CDO 有哪些资源和权力？CDO应该具备哪些专业能力？CDO汇报上级是谁？CDO 与CIO 及其他高层管理者的区别是什么？尤其是首席数据官对于企业绩效发挥怎样的作用？这一系列问题都亟待解决。\n\n本文重点讨论首席数据官的内涵、发展、实践等最新进展，并基于此为首席数据官选拔与培养、能力提升与培训、任命与岗位设置提供理论支持和管理建议。\n首席数据官起源\n\n本文讨论是专门管理数据或者管理数据资产的首席数据官（Chief Data Officer，CDO），而不是围绕业务数字化转型的首席数字官（ Chief Digital Officer）。依据wikipedia，第一位首席数据官在2002年出现在美国银行业。Linkedin上显示，在2002年-2005年期间第一资本（Capital One）银行中，由Cathy Doss女士担任首席数据官。而当前Cathy Doss女士在美国里奇蒙德联储(Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond) 担任副总裁兼任首席数据官，该职务旨在将数据政策、数据管理与相关监管法律和道德保持一致。在政府机构内，纽约市于2011年任命了Rachel Haot担任州政府的首席数据官，成为了美国首位地方政府CDO，主要职责是处理政府开放数据，在2012年Rachel Haot还同时担任着该州的首席信息管职务。\n点击查看原文>",
