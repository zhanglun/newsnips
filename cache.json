          "description": "直到现在，我做每一份工作的时候一开始都会定下两个目标：让自己毕业，然后在我被开掉之前就走人。自然，当我到了“已经毕业”和“是时候走人”的状态的时候，一段旅程就该结束了。3月2日，在我收到“欢迎来到谷歌！”邮件的那天后已经过了11年零2周，我交出自己的徽章，告别了一个当初没想到会待这么长时间，对它如此了解的组织。\n \n虽然我从谷歌工作的经历中学习并成长了很多，但在过去四年半我从事的Cloud AI和行业解决方案相关的工作中，之前积累数十年的产品和上市战略技能才是关键。虽然谷歌的经历本身就是一段迷人的旅程，但它应该不会改变我的人生才对。\n \n可是我的人生确实改变了。\n \n在谷歌担任的职位上，身为女性的我在由男性主导的各种环境中经历的那些事情，以及我的那些迂回曲折的职业道路——如果有人要我“分享一个关于你自己的有趣事实”，这些曲折的故事我讲都讲不完——交汇融合在了一起。我的人生使命随之浮现而出：负责任的人工智能。\n \n在这个职位上，我发现自己正在重拾当年攻读性别研究、性和教育心理学学位时学到的知识，并以全新的视角深入审视自己在学生时代学习的那些由无与伦比的Carol Gilligan讲授的精彩课程。当我们团队试图从单词和故事的表象中挖掘意义、理解和归属感时，我翻出了自己当年向初中和高中生教授文学课程的教案。当初我让孩子们沉浸在大自然中、学习传统野外技能并参与社区建设，并在这一过程中学到了同理心是如何诞生的，而今天我又重温了那段经历。我回顾了自己初探人类学民族志研究的那些时光。我回忆起了从斯坦福的设计学院学习的那些以人为本的设计课程。所有这些往事突然就展现出了它们的意义所在，让我倍感受用。\n点击查看原文>",
