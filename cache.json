          "description": "fawdlstty: \n仓库地址：https://github.com/fawdlstty/libfv\n介绍一款船新 HTTP 库。C++的 HTTP 库很多，但基于 C++20 的异步网络 HTTP 库几乎没有。我没找到好用的，因此写了一个。在讲解这个库之前，我先说说为什么我们需要这样的库。\nC++ HTTP 库有两种主要的实现方式，第一种是同步 HTTP 网络访问，比如这样的代码：\n// 伪代码\nResponse _r = HttpGet (\"https://t.cn\");\nstd::cout << _t.text;\n\n这样的代码写起来很简单，但它存在一个问题：HTTP 网络访问比较耗时，可能需要几百毫秒，这么长时间，这个线程将阻塞在这里，比较消耗线程资源。假如遇到需要同时发起几十、几百个请求，将较大消耗系统资源。很显然，它不是一个较好的设计。\n第二种是回调通知，比如这样的代码：\n// 伪代码\nHttpGet (\"https://t.cn\", [] (Response _r) {\nstd::cout << _t.text;\n});\n\n这种方式解决了线程问题，也就是，几十、几百个请求可以同时发起，只需要极少量或者一个线程就行，HTTP 库内部实现了请求的内部管理，在收到请求的回复后，调用回调函数，从而实现请求的高效处理。但这种方式有个问题，假如我们需要根据请求结果内容转给下一个请求，这会带来一个回调地狱问题，比如这样的代码：\n// 伪代码\nHttpGet (\"https://t.cn\", [] (Response _r) {\n    HttpGet (_t.text, [] (Response _r) {\n        HttpGet (_t.text, [] (Response _r) {\n            HttpGet (_t.text, [] (Response _r) {\n                HttpGet (_t.text, [] (Response _r) {\n                    std::cout << _t.text;\n                });\n            });\n        });\n    });\n});\n\n那么，有没更好的处理方式呢？有，通过 C++20 的 co_await 实现异步等待。下面给出 libfv 的发起请求的代码：\nfv::Response _r = co_await fv::Get (\"https://t.cn\");\n\n一方面它能获得回调方式的好处，也就是少量线程支撑同时大量的请求任务，同时它不会带来回调地狱问题。上面的代码通过 libfv 实现，代码可以这样写：\nfv::Response _r = co_await fv::Get (\"https://t.cn\");\n_r = co_await fv::Get (_r.text);\n_r = co_await fv::Get (_r.text);\n_r = co_await fv::Get (_r.text);\n_r = co_await fv::Get (_r.text);\nstd::cout << _t.text;\n\n这儿特别说明一下。单 CPU 处理效率来说，C++20 的异步性能比回调要低，大概 10%左右，也就是假设理论上跑满网络 IO 带宽情况，回调需要 10%的 CPU ，那么使用 C++20 的异步需要 11%，这是 stackless 需要付出的代价。当然，在我看来这个特性完全可以忽略，毕竟 IO 密集型应用首先需要考虑的是跑满网络带宽，一般不太需要关注 CPU 使用率。\nlibfv 使用方法见仓库：https://github.com/fawdlstty/libfv",

          "description": "GPT-4 正式发布的日子越来越近了。官方信息、当前趋势、未来预测，都在这里。\n\n\nGPT-3 首度亮相于大约两年之前的 2020 年 5 月，当时正值 GPT-2 发布的一年之后。而 GPT-2 距离最初 GPT 研究论文的发表也是相隔一年。如果这种周期性趋势继续保持不变，那 GPT-4 肯定也快跟大家见面了。但 OpenAI 公司 CEO Sam Altman 几个月前已经打过预防针，表示 GPT-4 预计会在 2022 年年内推出，具体可能是在 7 月到 8 月左右。\n\n虽然备受瞩目，但 GPT-4 目前的公开消息确实相当有限：它会是什么样子、带来怎样的特性或能力，一概不知。Altman 去年曾在一场问答中谈到过 OpenAI 对于 GPT-4 项目的规划，但同时也提醒与会者尽量保持冷静、不要过度乐观。如今七个月已经过去，咱们可以回头看看他的发言了。Altman 首先确认，GPT-4 的参数量不会达到 100 万亿，毕竟规模真到那个程度、今年年内也就不用指望了。\n\nOpenAI 很有一段时间没聊过 GPT-4 的事了，但结合 AI 领域、特别是 NLP 领域获得高度关注的热门趋势，我们倒是可以推断一下 GPT-4 的开发思路。考虑到这些方法大获成功、OpenAI 又都有参与其中，咱们可以从 Altman 的发言中整理出点线索。先说结论：我觉得 GPT-4 不会继续走模型越来越大的老路。\n\n下面来看关于 GPT-4 的具体预测。\n模型大小：GPT-4 不会走越来越大的老路\n\nGPT-4 不会在规模上刷新语言模型的新纪录。Altman 提到 GPT-4 不会比 GPT-3 大多少。虽然跟前几代神经网络相比，GPT-4 肯定也不算小，但其发展思路应该有所改变。我猜 GPT-4 可能介于 GPT-3 和 Gopher（1750 亿到 2800 亿参数）之间。\n点击查看原文>",
