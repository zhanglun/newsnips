          "description": "整理｜辛晓亮\n \n\n本周架构视点：知网“哭穷”：赔不起 1200 亿；微信公众号文章留言显示 IP 属地；程序员延寿指南霸榜 GitHub；联想高层大规模降薪；网易云音乐起诉腾讯音乐；GitHub 弃用 io；ARM 安谋中国 430 多名员工联名签署公开信，反对软银夺权；Firefox：我们不会卖给亿万富翁\n\n万万没想到\n知网被起诉，哭穷赔不起 1200 亿，网友：可笑\n \n据报道，湖北作家陈应松在今年初起诉知网，他此前在使用知网检索时发现，自己一共有 300 多篇文章被中国知网收录，其中许多文章已经被下载了几百次，可笑的是他在中国知网付费下载的一些文章，每篇收费 10 到 30 元。在得知中南财经政法大学赵德馨教授胜诉后，陈应松也开始起诉中国知网运营方（《中国学术期刊（光盘版）》电子杂志社有限公司），案件于今年 2 月 22 日开庭审理。\n \n据陈应松的代理律师表示，原告知名度较高，按照国家有关标准设定基础稿酬为 300 元/千字，同时综合原告的知名度和被告的侵权主观恶性明显、侵权时间长、影响大等情况，在此基础上加倍计算，最终提出了 1500 元/千字的赔偿标准。\n \n但知网的律师表示，这个赔偿要求太高，知网现在在数据库中的作品，如果按照陈应松的索赔标准，根本赔不起，即便按照之前赵德馨先生千字 200 元的标准，知网赔偿额度也将超过 1200亿，知网无法负担。对于知网哭穷表示赔不起一事，不少网友认为：“用别人的文章谋求利益这么多年，现在说赔不起了，可笑。”\n点击查看原文>",
