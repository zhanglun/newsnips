          "description": "仅仅在几年前，训练一个AI模型所需的时间还可能长达数周之久。\n\n这也是过去几年间，计算行业间涌现了众多价值数十亿美元的创新初创公司的重要原因所在——这些公司包括了Cerebras Systems、Graphcore、Habana Labs和SambaNova Systems等等。此外，谷歌、英特尔、英伟达和其他老牌公司也在企业内部投入了规模相当的巨额资金（有时还会发起收购计划）来探索这一领域。最新版本的MLPerf训练基准结果表明，这笔钱是物有所值的。\n\nMLPerf母公司MLCommons的执行董事David Kanter表示，自MLPerf基准测试开始上线以来，人工智能训练性能的提升速度“成功地大大超过了摩尔定律”。\n\n在早期版本的MLPerf基准测试最佳结果与2021年6月之后的基准测试最佳结果之间，晶体管密度的增长可以解释其中一倍多的差异。但是软件以及处理器和计算机架构的改进则贡献了6.8-11倍的成绩增长。在最新的1.1版测试中，最佳结果是6月份最佳成绩的2.3倍。\n\n根据英伟达的说法，使用A100 GPU的系统的性能相比18个月前的系统提高了5倍以上，相比三年前MLPerf基准测试成绩首次发布时的结果提高了20倍。\n\n微软首次将其Azure云AI产品引入了MLPerf，使用各种资源在所有八个测试网络中取得了极佳的成绩。它们的规模从2个AMD Epyc CPU和8个英伟达A100 GPU，直到512个CPU和2048个GPU不等。规模显然很重要。顶级规格的系统在不到一分钟的时间内就训练完了AI模型，而二八组合通常需要20分钟或更长时间。\n点击查看原文>",
