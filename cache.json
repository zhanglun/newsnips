          "description": "在策划2022年3月25-26日PCon产品创新大会的时候，也为听众们准备了产品运营和用户增长的专题，希望将业界成熟的经验传递给各位听众。偶然间看到黄有璨老师早年间的一次演讲，讲的就是产品增长的话题，而且他在产品运营方面经验丰富，擅于总结，精于提炼，形成自己的方法论。遂将演讲进行整理。\n \n自增长的话题并不是一个全新的话题，不管是做产品规划，还是做运营，其底层逻辑都可以围绕下图这张产品生命周期来展开讲。\n \n这张图是1966年哈佛大学福农教授提出的，不管产品是什么属性，具备什么样的功能，它发展的过程基本上都会遵从图上呈横向S状曲线的趋势。\n\n\n\n一款产品在引入期，用户对产品并不信任，所以新产品上线之初，功能不完善，流程也不顺，增长缓慢，这也是很正常的现象。在运营上应该重点关注用户口碑，尤其是要有优质的容错性比较高的用户，然后给他们超出预期的体验，因为他们有了超出预期的体验，就有了用户口碑，借由这些口碑再去做增长会是比较顺畅的。\n点击查看原文>",
