          "description": "作者 | 潘政@达坦科技（DatenLord）\n简介和背景\nEtcd是一个支持强一致性的分布式KV存储，主要用于metadata的管理、服务发现、分布式锁等场景。DatenLord使用etcd来管理集群的metadata，DatenLord的应用会频繁查询etcd中的metadata，但是极少更改，是典型的读多写少的场景。在使用过程中我们发现一次etcd操作带来的网络开销成为了性能瓶颈，所以我们想到通过实现客户端缓存的方式来省去不必要的网络的开销。具体想法是在客户端缓存查询结果，这样每次需要查询etcd的时候，如果缓存命中，则只需要访问一次本地内存省掉一次网络开销，如果没有命中，再到etcd中查询，并将查询结果加入缓存，这极大地降低了频繁查询etcd所带来的开销和延迟。接下来会详细介绍我们的实现和遇到的问题以及解决方案。\nEtcd Watch机制\n在启用缓存之后就会面临本地缓存更新的问题，因为etcd是一个分布式的KV存储，允许多个客户端并发操作并保证一致性，那么如果其他客户端更新了etcd中的数据，那么如何更新本客户端本地缓存中的数据呢？一个方案是定时轮询etcd来获取数据更新，但是这个方案有明显弊端，如轮询的间隔设定，如果设置过大将无法及时更新本地缓存，导致长时间拿到旧的数据，如果设置很短，随着本地缓存数据量的增加，逐一轮询会同时增加etcd和客户端的负担。\n\n幸运的是etcd提供了watch机制可以克服轮询方案的弊端。etcd的watch机制允许客户端告诉etcd它要关注的key，如果该key有任何修改，etcd会通知客户端。具体实现方式是在客户端和服务器端建立一个长连接，这个长连接提供了两个功能，1. 客户端会通过这个长连接来告诉etcd它要watch的key，以及不再想watch某些key，即对应WatchCreateRequest和WatchCancelRequest。watch请求可以针对单个key或者prefix。2. watch请求成功后，只要该key或者满足prefix的key有更新，etcd就会通过这个长连接以WatchResponse的形式通知到客户端。需要注意的是所有的watch请求都复用这一条长连接。我们来看一下WatchCreateRequest，WatchCancelRequest，WatchResponse，Event的protobuf定义\n\nmessage WatchCreateRequest {\n  bytes key = 1;\n  bytes range_end = 2;\n  int64 start_revision = 3;\n  bool progress_notify = 4;\n\n  enum FilterType {\n    NOPUT = 0;\n    NODELETE = 1;\n  }\n  repeated FilterType filters = 5;\n  bool prev_kv = 6;\n}\n\nmessage WatchCancelRequest {\n   int64 watch_id = 1;\n}\n\nmessage WatchResponse {\n  ResponseHeader header = 1;\n  int64 watch_id = 2;\n  bool created = 3;\n  bool canceled = 4;\n  int64 compact_revision = 5;\n\n  repeated mvccpb.Event events = 11;\n}\n\nmessage Event {\n  enum EventType {\n    PUT = 0;\n    DELETE = 1;\n  }\n  EventType type = 1;\n  KeyValue kv = 2;\n  KeyValue prev_kv = 3;\n}\n\n\n具体每个field的意义请参考官方文档，就不一一解释，这里只介绍我们关心的field.\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "质量和效率是前端研发永恒的话题。而 DevOps 的主要特点是通过对构建软件的所有环节（从集成、测试、发布到部署和基础架构管理）进行全面的自动化和监控，以此来提升质量和效率。\n\nDevOps 的概念已提出十余年，很多公司都在不断地探索和实践。有些用于促进开发（应用程序 / 软件工程）、技术运营和质量保障部门之间的沟通、协作与整合；有些则运用这种模式对产品进行快速迭代，验证产品的可行性，帮助产品快速上线。然而，快速迭代意味着产品需要频繁地部署上线，会给研发、测试和运维团队带来一系列问题，比如较高频率地上线产品可能会导致研发质量降低，影响用户体验；测试不充分，上线后 bug 层出不穷；运维上线部署慢，跟不上研发的节奏等等。\n\n前端作为离用户“最近”的角色，DevOps 之路也丰富多彩，为了给大家提供更多的借鉴和思考，将于 8 月举办的 GMTC 全球大前端技术大会（北京站）上，我们策划了「前端 DevOps 实践」专题，邀请到美团基础技术部前端技术中心负责人王鹤担任出品人，此次策划我们将围绕“持续集成”、“自动化”和“可视化”3 个关键词展开，通过以点带面的方式，给你带来一场庖丁解牛式的 DevOps 经验和实践路径分享。\n\n\n\n目前我们已经确定了来自阿里、美团和 58 同城的三个议题：\n\n1. CI/CD 在钉钉前端的实践\n\n阿里巴巴高级前端技术专家孟红伦（云际）将分享钉钉在软件研发中遇到的质量和效率问题，以及其在自动化测试的实践细节与经验。\n点击查看原文>",
