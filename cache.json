          "description": "多年以来，马斯克多次承诺自动驾驶汽车即将到来\n\n事实证明，自动驾驶汽车的底层技术极难完善。就算是备受期待的特斯拉也没能跨越这道障碍。\n\n特斯拉公司CEO埃隆·马斯克曾在今年1月放出豪言，“如果我们今年年内还不能让自动驾驶汽车的安全性超越人类，那简直是见了鬼了。”\n\n问题是，他已经不是第一次做此承诺了。2020年，他就表示要在年内实现自动驾驶汽车，还强调“目前已经不存在核心难题。”再往前一年，2019年他曾承诺特斯拉会在2020年之前实现自动驾驶，甚至打造一支由百万辆“机器人汽车”组成的出租车队。其实从2014年开始，他每年都会做出类似的预测。\n\n从2020年底开始，特斯拉开始将自家“全自动驾驶”（FSD）的Beta测试版开放给约6万名特斯拉车主。除了接受安全测试，这些车主还得花12000美元才能获得首批特权——纯纯的“冤种”了属于是。客户们将率先体验自动驾驶辅助技术，并帮助特斯拉在全面发布该功能前做出调整和改进。\n\n亚利桑那州立大学风险创新实验室主任Andrew Maynard表示，随着测试版的推出，特斯拉明显走上了软件企业的常规路线——让用户亲自发现问题。“但区别在于，软件崩溃只会导致计算机重启；而汽车碰撞却可能造成重大伤亡。”\n\n而且纵观整个自动驾驶汽车行业，还没有其他哪家公司敢把这种半成品技术交给普通客户。以Alphabet旗下的Waymo、通用汽车支持的Cruise以及自动驾驶初创公司Aurora为例，他们只会安排操作员在预定路线上开展技术测试。\n点击查看原文>",
