          "description": "4rfv5tgb: \n萌新初学消息队列， 不懂就问。今天看了下 rabbitmq 的文档，有关于 prefetch_count 的设置，这个是设置消费者能拥有最多的未 ack 的消息的数量。我看官方文档说, 即使重新入队也会保证顺序。假设单个消费者，生产者发送消息 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10, 如果 prefetch_count 设置成 30 ，那么假如 5 消息失败了没有手动 ack ，requeue 重新入队。但是 6 ，7 ，8 ，9 ，10 消费成功并且都 ack 了，这时候虽然消息看起来是按照顺序 push 了，但是消息这边消费的顺序有没有可能是 1->2->3->4->6->7->8->9->10->5 这样的顺序。我有这样的疑问： \n1.在需要保证顺序的场景，现实场景中上面的情况大家都是怎么做的呢？\n2.消息是否有必要持久化落表？比如说记录消费失败的 message\n附上文档：\nMessage ordering guarantees\nSection 4.7 of the AMQP 0-9-1 core specification explains the conditions under which ordering is guaranteed: messages published in one channel, passing through one exchange and one queue and one outgoing channel will be received in the same order that they were sent. RabbitMQ offers stronger guarantees since release 2.7.0.\n\nMessages can be returned to the queue using AMQP methods that feature a requeue parameter (basic.recover, basic.reject and basic.nack), or due to a channel closing while holding unacknowledged messages. Any of these scenarios caused messages to be requeued at the back of the queue for RabbitMQ releases earlier than 2.7.0. From RabbitMQ release 2.7.0, messages are always held in the queue in publication order, even in the presence of requeueing or channel closure.\n\nWith release 2.7.0 and later it is still possible for individual consumers to observe messages out of order if the queue has multiple subscribers. This is due to the actions of other subscribers who may requeue messages. From the perspective of the queue the messages are always held in the publication order.",

          "description": "2021年，网易数帆大数据团队正式提出数据生产力的理念，数据生产力从广义上讲，是指“通过使用数据，带来组织生产力的提升”；从狭义上讲，是指“数据采集、清洗、加工、可视化等数据处理和数据治理的软件生产能力以及持续运营能力”。\n\n\n数据生产力的愿景是构建“人人用数据，时时用数据”的企业数据文化，愿景代表的是目标和方向，支撑这个目标的达成，必然需要一系列的方法论。方法论，是以解决问题为目标，通过对具体方法的分析和总结，提出的一般性原则。方法论可以指引技术的发展方向。很多从事数据分析的人，容易沉溺于技术实现，而忽视技术背后的方法论。在数据分析的历史上，其实诞生过很多优秀的方法论，这些方法论指导了数据分析技术的不断演进和迭代。\n历史上出现过的方法论\n1970年，IBM的研究员，有“关系数据库之父”之称的埃德加·弗兰克·科德（Edgar Frank Codd或E. F. Codd）博士在刊物《Communication of the ACM》上发表了题为“A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data banks（大型共享数据库的关系模型）”的论文，文中首次提出了数据库的关系模型的概念，奠定了关系模型的理论基础。\n\n1973年，Don Chamberlin博士在研发System R项目时，使用结构化英语查询语言作为关系数据库的操作语言，SQL由此诞生。关系数据库和SQL语言提供了基础的信息表达和统计能力，在此指引下，Oracle 无疑是关系数据库时代最成功的商业化产品。\n\n\n\n点击查看原文>",
