          "description": "编者按：数字化转型最重要的能力是什么？政策解读能力。\n \n本轮数字化转型最大的特点是不能只站在企业内部视角去看数字化，那样无法观察到数字化变革的全局，容易找不到方向，容易出现自己很勤奋却依然跑输行业的问题。这轮数字化转型背后最大的动力来自时代的变迁，这种时代的变迁集中体现在了国家的一系列政策文件中，如果你正对数字化的奥秘百思不得其解，为什么不考虑认真看看政策呢？政策是集体智慧的结晶，也是经过了深入调研和对大量信息的研判的，并且，是有一定指导性甚至强制性的。政策能够指挥资源的流动，也能给企业带来很多实在，跟着政策大方向走，就是所谓的政策红利。脱离政策方向，不仅跑起来很累，也可能会出问题，前几年大数据爬虫、P2P的教训依然历历在目，技术是中性的，受了罚，技术自己也不知道，但是掌握技术的人就未必了。\n \n数字化转型政策的密集和体系的完整在以往也是不多见的，这是围绕着经济增长模式升级进行的全方位推动，必然涉及所有行业，这一点，大家看看国家统计局针对数字经济做的统计口径调整就明白了。政策从中央到地方、从全局到行业、从文件到法规，发起了一场对数字经济的全面适应性调整，最终没有一个企业会游离其外。所以，不要再闭起门来思考数字化了，更不要只从技术视角看数字化，信息传播如此发达的今天，政策可以轻易传导到每一个从业者的今天，不能再以为自己可以有“小生态”，社会其实只有一个“大生态”，没有真的可以不被影响和渗透的“小生态”。\n \n银行业一直是政策指导性很强的行业，这一点也许跟很多行业有些不同，所以，监管文件对银行行为的影响非常直接。2021年底和2022年初，银行业出台了两份最重要的行业数字化转型指导性文件，分别来自央行和银保监会，数字化转型也将纳入对银行的考核了，这会让很多银行的数字化转型进程加快、加深，本文以架构视角全面解读这两份文件，也希望这种解读方式可以对其他行业有一定的借鉴，毕竟，各个行业都有自己的数字化转型或者十四五发展规划，其作用也跟这两份文件非常相似，对企业的价值也是极大的。\n \n这轮数字化转型是国家政策和企业架构双轮驱动的数字化转型，读完本文，读者可能会更加理解这一点。\n点击查看原文>",
