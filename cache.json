You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "我们渴望通过数据来增强和改善商业和生活的各个方面，这驱使我们在大规模管理数据方面进行范式转变。尽管过去十年的技术进步已解决了数据量和数据处理计算的规模问题，但它们无法解决其他方面的规模问题：数据格局的变化，数据来源的泛滥，数据用例和用户的多样性 ，以及对变化的响应速度。Data Mesh解决了这些问题，它由以下四个原则组成：面向领域的去中心化数据所有权和架构，数据即产品，自助服务数据基础设施即平台，联合治理。每个原则都驱动着技术架构和人员组织结构的新的逻辑视图。\n\n当前，许多企业面临的挑战在于如何在技术架构和人员组织层面形成数据驱动、运用数据建立竞争优势以及规模化地利用数据驱动价值，“从单体数据湖到分布式数据网格”对上述痛点有深入的理解（我鼓励您先阅读该文章）。它提供了一种替代的观点，该观点吸引了许多组织的注意力，并给我们带来了一个不同前景的希望。虽然这篇文章描述了这种观点，但它在很多设计和实现的细节上留下了让人想象的空间。我并不想在本文中过分规范这些，以至于扼杀了大家实现Data Mesh的想象力和创造力。但是，我认为作为推动范式向前发展的垫脚石，本文只负责在架构层面规范它的定义。\n\n本文是上述文章的后续， 它通过列举Data Mesh的基本原则和这些原则驱动的高级逻辑架构，总结出了Data Mesh方法。在我之后写文章深入研究Data Mesh核心组件的详细架构之前，建立高级逻辑模型是非常必要的。因此，如果您正在为Data Mesh寻求确切的工具和方法，那么本文可能会让您感到失望。如果您正在寻求简单且无关技术细节的模型来建立描述该方法的通用语言，请快来。\n合理划分数据\n数据到底是什么？这个问题的答案取决于您问谁。从现阶段的视角来看， 我们将数据分为业务数据和分析型数据。业务数据位于业务微服务背后的数据库中，它具有事务性，能够记录当前状态并且满足业务应用的需求。分析型数据是一段时间内业务事实形成的聚合视图，它的数据模型通常被用来支持历史数据分析或未来趋势预测， 也用于机器学习的模型训练或生成分析报告。目前，技术、架构和组织结构的现状都反映了业务与分析数据平面的差异，它们集成在一起但是又相互独立存在。这种差异使架构变得脆弱。对于那些试图连接这两个平面，想要将数据从业务数据平面流转到分析平面然后再返回到业务数据平面的人来说，不断失败的ETL（提取，转换，加载）流程以及日益复杂的数据管道迷宫是一个很常见的现象。\n\n图1：合理划分数据\n点击查看原文>",
