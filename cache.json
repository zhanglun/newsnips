          "description": "嘉宾：高楼\n编辑：李慧文\n \n\n很多人眼里的性能，不过是开发的边角料，看待性能工程师，天然就戴着一副有色眼镜。其实，一个可以独立做性能分析的人，在市场上抢都抢不到。可是，怎么才能成为这样的性能工程师呢？InfoQ深度采访盾山科技 CEO、7DGroup 创始人，他也是 2022年 QCon+ 【自动化测试】专题的出品人。他将从底层为你揭秘性能高手的思维模式，以期帮助大量性能工程师们拨开职业的迷雾，登上身价百万的台阶。\n\n \n我选择测试是因为它需要完善的逻辑思维能力\n \nInfoQ：您是为什么会选择性能这个方向的？\n \n高楼：在我2005年刚毕业那会，IT 还是个很好的就业方向，薪资高，而软件测试尚处于萌芽阶段，新潮且未知。那时很多人选择测试是因为不用写代码就可以拿到高薪。而我选择测试是因为我觉得测试是需要完善的逻辑思维能力的。它包括的范围不仅是代码，从操作系统到上层应用、数据库等等。\n \n具体来说，我的第一份工作是路由器测试，不仅包括功能测试，也包括性能，可以写代码做，也需要用到硬件测试仪。这份工作中并不是把功能验证一下、代码能跑起来就行了，关键的是得懂各种协议。对协议的深入理解，才是测试的前提。我觉得非常有意思，也学习到了不少知识。\n点击查看原文>",
