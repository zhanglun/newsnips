Another problem is that there's fewer Android paying users on tablets than on iPad, so the sales may not be able to cover the development and on-going update cost.\nIn view of this we don't have a plan for an Android version in the short term but we'll continue to evaluate the market.",

          "description": "容器相比虚拟机最突出的特点之一便是轻量化和快速启动。相比虚拟机动辄十几个G的镜像，容器镜像只包含应用以及应用所需的依赖库，所以可以做到几百M 甚至更少。但即便如此，几十秒的镜像拉取还是在所难免，如果镜像更大，则耗费时间更长。\n \n我们团队（阿里云弹性容器ECI）分析了 3000 个不同业务Pod 的启动时间，具体如下图。可以看出，在Pod 启动过程中，镜像拉取部分耗时最长。大部分 Pod 需要 30s 才能将镜像拉下来，这极大增加了容器的启动时间。\n\n如果是大规模启动，这个问题则会变得更糟糕。镜像仓库会因为镜像并发拉取导致带宽打满或者服务端压力过大而直接崩溃。\n \n我们多次遇到过这个问题。由于一个服务的副本数达到 1000+ ，在迅速扩容 1000+ 多个实例的时候，很多Pod 都处于Pending状态，等待镜像拉取。\n \n虽然 kubernetes 在调度的时候已经支持镜像的亲和性，但只针对老镜像，如果并发启动的新镜像的话，还是需要从镜像仓库里面拉取。下面提供几种常用的解决思路。\n点击查看原文>",
