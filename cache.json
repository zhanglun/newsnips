          "description": "beaver0108: \n废话少说，先上公众号二维码和小程序码（二者功能不完全相同），方便不想看我啰嗦的朋友试用。\n\n\n\n\n\n如果扫码不方便，可以微信搜索“树影取名”。\n搜索的话会搜到“树影取名”小程序和公众号，两个功能不完全相同，至于为啥不同，也是迫于无奈，这就是另一个故事了，后面再说。\n先介绍功能\n主要功能四个：\n查找名字出处\n测算姓名运势及和八字是否相合\n诗词结合八字取名\n名字诗句接龙\n如果想查名字出处，使用小程序也可以，关注公众号从公众号菜单进入也可以。小程序关于名字出处的附加功能更多。\n如果想取名或者测姓名运势，要使用公众号。\n如果想玩名字诗句接龙，要使用小程序。\n1 、查找名字出处\n从古典诗词中查找你名字的出处，如：”诸葛孔明“。\n\n输入名字后选一个典籍库，就可以查看了。\n可以分享给朋友，可以发群，也可以分享到朋友圈，当然，生成一个图片是最直观的，所以提供了生成图片的功能，图片的排版也更好一些：\n\n这个功能上线有一段时间了，已经被朋友们玩坏，比如：\n\n\n\n\n\n当然，也有人背几句包含妹纸名字的诗，去讨好妹纸。\n我只管开发，怎么玩你们说了算。\n2 、测算姓名运势及和八字是否相合\n这个功能只有公众号有。\n作为一个姓名类的平台，能测算姓名吉凶是必须的。\n通过笔划、五行等测算姓名的运势，也可以测算姓名和八字是否相合。\n\n这个功能也被玩坏了，有人用来算要不要买比特币：\n\n也有人算了这个，表示这就是“傻人有傻福”吧。\n\n这个。。。\n玄学的东西，你们玩的开心就好。。。\n3 、诗词结合八字取名\n这个功能只有公众号有。\n通常我们觉得“起名”和“取名”是一个意思，实际上还是有所不同的，“取名”更侧重于从典籍中取出一两个字来作为名字，这样一来，可能看起来不起眼的两个字，一下子就有了意境深远的含义。\n对于即将有宝宝的人来说，这是个很有用的功能，只要提供姓氏和出生时间，就可以从诗词中取名了，所取的名字，都和八字相合，并且姓名吉凶运势都没有“凶”的项，拿到打分网站上，至少也得有 80 分。\n这个也不能说是迷信，算是对宝宝人生的一种寄托吧。\n\n4 、名字诗句接龙\n这个功能只有小程序有，是春节的时候脑洞一开想的一个功能，就是你找到一个包含你名字的诗句，可以分享给朋友，让朋友也接上一句包含他名字的。这样接来接去，就形成了一条独一无二的长链。\n某种意义上像以前的百衲衣，带着祝福和期许，不同的是百衲衣是物理世界一块块的布头组成，这个是虚拟世界一句句的诗句组成，不但带着每个人的祝福，也把诗人穿越千年的才华通过诗句带过来了。\n所以我起了名字叫“才福链”，有才华又有福气。\n既然说到链了，这个天然就可以用在区块链上，未来会考虑上真的区块链，这样就可以让每条“才福链”都成为一个去中心化的永恒存在了。\n5 、其他辅助功能\n如：\n查找名字出处或取名时如果有多个都喜欢拿不定选定哪个，可以加入到\"备选\"；\n取名还可以把名字加入投票，投票可以通过微信分享给请亲朋好友帮忙投票，以做参考；\n对诗句不太理解的话可以查看诗句赏析，还可以请朋友帮忙赏析。",
