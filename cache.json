          "description": "为什么要做 Spring Cloud Tencent\nSpring Boot + Spring Cloud 仍是 Java 生态最主流的框架\n\n2014 年 4 月 Spring Boot 发布 1.0 版本，经过 8 年时间的发展，Spring Boot 已然成为 Java 开发框架的事实标准。在分布式微服务领域，2016 年 1 月 Spring Cloud 发布 Angel.SR5 版本。Spring Cloud 延承了 Spring Boot 最核心的组件化、低配置快速集成的核心思想，同时定义了一套标准的微服务 SPI。基于这套 SPI 出现了 Spring Cloud Netfix 等优秀的微服务解决方案实现套件。在远程服务调用框架方面，Feign 和 RestTemplate 基于普适的 HTTP 协议，在易用性、可观测性、跨语言等方面具备天然的优势。所以 Spring Cloud 自 2016 年发布第一个版本之后蓬勃发展。\n\n从行业情况看，Spring Boot + Spring Cloud 是目前 Java 使用最广泛的开发框架之一。\n\n2018 年开始以 Istio 为代表的 ServiceMesh 开始在社区中孵化，到 2022 年已经有非常多的 ServiceMesh 产品。ServiceMesh 核心思想是下沉服务调用相关的基础能力到独立的 Sidecar 进程，通过流量代理的方式治理流量。任何一种方案都不是万能药， Sidecar 模式也存在一些问题。例如：高度依赖底层 Paas 能力治理 Sidecar （注入、版本管理、升级等）、Sidecar 需要额外占用一定的资源、增加一定的网络延迟、增加排障难度等。所以国内真正能够落地 ServiceMesh 的企业并不多。\n\n综上所述，我们认为在未来很长一段时间内 Spring Boot + Spring Cloud 仍是 Java 主流的微服务解决方案，虽然它看上去没有像 Istio、Dapr 那样的先进。在满足企业业务发展诉求的前提下，低成本、高效、稳定的架构方案才是最好的方案。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "亚马逊最近宣布，AWS DataSync现在支持将Google Cloud Storage和Azure Files存储作为存储位置。数据服务的这两个新选项有助于数据在AWS中的移入和移出，但数据传输费用可能仍然是一个限制条件。\n \nDataSync可以跨不同的存储位置复制和同步数据，并且能将其移动到AWS中，从而支持多云工作流或数据保留的需求。DataSync依靠专有网络协议来运行并验证一次性和周期性的数据传输，并根据作业的大小进行扩展。该服务提供了包括/排除筛选器、带宽限制控制，并支持从临时网络问题中自动恢复。AWS EMEA（欧洲、中东和非洲区域）首席布道师Danilo Poccia解释道：\n \n\n通过这种方式，可以简化数据处理或存储整合任务。如果你需要与使用Google Cloud Storage或微软Azure Files的客户、供应商或合作伙伴进行数据的导入、共享和交换，这也会很有帮助。DataSync提供了端到端的安全性，包括加密和完整性验证。\n\n \nGoogle Cloud Storage和Azure Files存储是首批针对竞争对手提供服务的源，但它们并不是唯一受支持的存储位置：AWS DataSync可以与NFS、SMB、Hadoop分布式文件系统（HDFS）、自管理对象存储以及不同的AWS服务（比如Amazon S3或Amazon FSx）进行数据同步。\n点击查看原文>",
