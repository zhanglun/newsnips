          "description": "BeautifulSoap: \n深夜整个人项目，泛型函数单元测试写到吐血了，发帖来吐槽下。单元测试我们知道，一般写法是像下面这样用表驱动测试来写（用到了匿名 struct ）：\nfunc Add(a, b int) int {\nreturn a + b\n}\n\n// ========== 单元测试分界线 ============\nfunc TestAdd(t *testing.T) {\n    // 这里定义了一个匿名的 struct ，让代码更简洁容易维护\ntests := []struct {\nname string\na    int\nb    int\nwant int\n}{\n{\nname: \"ok\",\na:    1,\nb:    1,\nwant: 2,\n},\n{\nname: \"ok2\",\na:    10,\nb:    10,\nwant: 20,\n},\n}\nfor _, tt := range tests {\nt.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\nif got := Add(tt.a, tt.b); got != tt.want {\nt.Errorf(\"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\")\n}\n})\n}\n}\n\n但如果是泛型函数的话，因为目前存在几个问题：\n匿名函数无法使用泛型\n匿名结构体无法使用泛型\n无法在函数里定义非匿名函数\n所以泛型函数的单元测试代码就变成了下面这样的写法：\n\nfunc Add[T constraints.Ordered](a, b T) T {\nreturn a + b\n}\n\n// ======== 单元测试分界线 ===========\n// 必须在测试函数外单独定义测试用例的结构体\ntype testCase[T constraints.Ordered] struct {\nname string\na    T\nb    T\nwant T\n}\n\n// 同时还必须在测试函数外定义一个执行泛型用例的泛型函数\nfunc runTestCases[T constraints.Ordered](t *testing.T, cases []testCase[T]) {\nfor _, tt := range cases {\nt.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\nif got := Add(tt.a, tt.b); !reflect.DeepEqual(got, tt.want) {\nt.Errorf(\"xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\")\n}\n})\n}\n}\n\n\n// 单元测试函数\nfunc TestAdd(t *testing.T) {\nintTestCases := []testCase[int]{\n{\nname: \"ok\",\na:    1,\nb:    1,\nwant: 2,\n},\n{\nname: \"ok2\",\na:    10,\nb:    10,\nwant: 20,\n},\n}\nstrCases := []testCase[string]{\n{\nname: \"ok\",\na:    \"A\",\nb:    \"B\",\nwant: \"AB\",\n},\n{\nname: \"ok2\",\na:    \"Hello\",\nb:    \"World\",\nwant: \"HelloWorld\",\n},\n}\nrunTestCases(t, intTestCases)\nrunTestCases(t, strCases)\n}\n\n\n也许你会说不就是多定义了个函数还有结构体类型吗，但是我想说的是就是因为这个问题，导致这样子的单元测试代码写起来真的太折磨人了，非常烦人。这段时间我写泛型函数的单元测试都要写吐血了\n最重要的是，如果我们在一个文件里定义了多个函数，那么也往往会把他们的单元测试给统一写到同一个 _test.go 文件里。 这种写法导致的结果就是点开一个单元测试代码，里面满眼都是定义在单元测试函数之外的 type xxxTestCase Struct{} 结构体还有  runXXXTestCases[T xxx]() 的泛型函数。可读性和维护起来非常难受。为了可读性解决办法只有一个：给每个泛型函数单独整个 _test.go 文件\n嗯，上面就是我的深夜吐槽。不知道今后有没有什么好的工具能结束这种痛苦的写法",

          "description": "Docker是现在的开发人员都已经很熟悉的平台。它使得我们可以更容易地在容器中创建、部署和运行应用程序。所需的依赖会被“打包”并且以进程的方式运行在主机操作系统上，而不是像虚拟机那样为每个工作负载都重复使用操作系统。这就避免了机器之间微小的配置差异。\n\n因为Docker使这种方式流行了起来，所以很多人都在讨论Docker容器和Docker镜像。实际上，镜像和容器并不一定非“Docker”不可，它们可以基于类似的框架。\n\n随着云原生编程的普及，Docker本身和Docker这种方式也在不断发展。云原生这个术语有多种定义，但是它主要指的是在云基础设施上运行应用程序，这里所说的应用程序很可能是基于微服务架构的。它会使用自动化工具，以及云供应商的资源和功能。在这种编程风格中，像Docker这样的容器化工具通常会很有用，因为容器的内容和搭建过程会形成一个可重复的环境，不受底层系统的影响。\n\n如果你正在使用Docker的话，你可能也想知道它对你的应用来讲是否足够安全。和许多系统一样，我们不能简单地用是或者不是来回答“Docker是否安全？”这个问题。以安全的方式使用Docker是可以实现的，但是我们需要考虑采取一些行动才行。\n\n在本文中，我们将会探讨Docker相关的最重要的安全因素。\nDocker与Docker镜像\n为了解决Docker的安全问题，我们需要理解在容器中运行镜像的Docker以及Docker镜像本身的差异。\n点击查看原文>",
