          "description": "lanlanye: \n不知道各位写代码时会不会经常觉得遇到以下问题：\n某个听起来很自然的功能实现起来却需要绕很大一圈。\n某个功能的实现不可避免的会影响到许多不相关的功能。\n迭代到某个阶段，软件的响应越来越慢，逻辑越来越复杂，开发人员已经搞不懂自己在做什么了。\n...\n以上只是我遇到许许多多问题中的一小部分，毕业快两年，我时常觉得自己写出的东西随着功能的增加离自己的设想越来越远，即使满足了业务需要也无法让自己满意。\n我认为开发难以进行的根源往往不是因为开发人员不会写业务代码，而是设计上出现了不合理的地方，有时是因为初期没有时间仔细考虑，有时是因为不可避免的需要与其他项目耦合，然而归根结底是开发者的设计能力不足，没能让软件保持低耦合与高内聚。\n近一个多月的时间，我试着通过各种渠道补充相关知识，从 数据库设计的一个小问题 到流行的架构模式和设计模式逐步学习，深感从 Python 开始开发一定程度上让我低估了面向对象设计的重要性。\n以下是我最近读过或正在读的书单（按时间顺序）：\n《数学之美》\n《 SQL 反模式》\n微软公开的 Azure 设计模式说明\n《实现领域驱动设计》\n《设计模式》\n《领域驱动设计·精简版》\n《领域驱动设计·软件核心复杂性应对之道》\n顺序上存在一些不合理的地方，比如《实现领域驱动设计》中提到了许多我难以理解的概念，这些概念是通过穿插着阅读后面几本书以及通过搜索引擎才逐渐能够理解的（以及我至今也没能把这本书彻底读完），这些书中也会引用其他人的著作，受限于时间我也没能逐个阅读，比如《分析模式》、《重构》等。\n可是直至目前我依然有很多疑问：印象里不久前还经常被人提起的“函数式编程”有什么优势？如果面向对象设计是一种“最佳实践”，为什么后来诞生的语言没有特别强调自己面向对象的特性？\n简言之，我隐约感觉自己遇到了瓶颈，我不确定这些疑惑是否会随着不断学习而得到解答，同时也很担心自己绕了远路钻了牛角尖，所以 希望站内的大佬们可以推荐一些相关书籍或者分享一些自己的学习经历、见解 。\n另外，我建了一个 QQ 群，希望 和我有同样困惑或相似目标 的人能够加入进来共同交流进步。这是一个尝试，我希望它是一个单纯的技术交流群，没有日常寒暄和无意义水群，不会因为过多的消息被人屏蔽，如果实在做不到我也可能解散掉它，群号 OTAyMzE0NDEz",

          "description": "在软件架构和应用设计领域，设计模式是基本的构建块之一。设计模式的概念是由Christopher Alexander在上世纪70年代末提出来的（The Timeless Way of Building, 1979以及A Pattern Language—Towns, Buildings, Construction, 1977）：\n\n\n每个模式都描述了一个在我们的环境中不断出现的问题，然后描述了该问题的解决方案的核心。通过这种方式，我们可以无数次地使用那些已有的解决方案，而无需重复相同的工作。—— Alexander et al\n\n\n随后，这个概念被软件社区所采用，从而产生了应用于软件设计领域的不同种类的设计模式。\n\n面向对象的设计模式是一个抽象工具，用来设计遵循OOP方式的代码级别的构建块。Erich Gamma、Richard Helm、Ralph Johnson和John Vlissides（Gangs of Four - GoF）合作撰写的图书Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software（中译本名为《设计模式：可复用面向对象软件的基础》由机械工业出版社出版——译者注）为开发人员提供了面向对象设计领域的一个指导手册。这本书于1994年首次出版，从那时起，设计模式就成为了软件设计的一个组成部分。\n\n设计模式也适用于组织。一个大型的组织确实就像一台庞大的机器，它有很多的齿轮、管道、过滤器、马达等等。在数字时代，我们正在试图将人脑数字化，因此将企业机器进行数字化并不是什么了不起的事情。将企业的某一组成部分或者某一区域实现数字化是不够的。实际上，要操控一个企业，就必须要集成其所有不同的组成部分。企业和解决方案架构师在尝试使用模式来解决日常的集成场景。这个过程是真正敏捷的。每天，来自世界各个角落的思想家们都在解决问题，并发明新的企业集成模式。在这里，我想要提及该领域的两位大师，Martin Fowler和Gregor Hohpe。\n\n高层管理人员在不断追逐新的技术趋势，每天都有新的数字产品变种问世。商业人士都想方设法在这个数字海洋中获取最大的利益，所以有必要对遗留系统进行现代化改造，也就是所谓的数字化转型。在这个领域中，像Ian Cartwright、Rob Horn、James Lewis这样的研究人员也基于他们多年的迁移经验，在最近的Patterns of Legacy Displacement文章中提出了一些模式。\n点击查看原文>",
