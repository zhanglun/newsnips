          "description": "5 月 9 日，Cloudflare 在其官方博客宣布，将与 Node.js 和 Deno 开源项目的核心贡献者合作，成立一个新的社区组，命名为 WinterCG（Web-interoperable Runtimes Community Group），该项目汇集了三个最大的 JavaScript 环境，为开发人员提供了灵活性和选择，同时创建边缘计算的未来标准。通过一套通用标准，允许在 Node.js、Deno 和 Cloudflare 无服务器环境中编写可移植的应用程序，同时不再需要重写代码，实现“编写一次，随处运行”的承诺。\n\nCloudflare 联合创始人兼首席执行官 Matthew Prince 表示，“这是一个以前无法实现的壮举。JavaScript 正在被数以百万计的开发人员使用，也是一般开发者学习的第一种语言。到目前为止，JavaScript 标准完全集中在前端，比如浏览器。” Matthew Prince 补充道，“通过对核心 JavaScript API 的标准化，同时兼顾到前端和后端，这样可以授权前端开发者以一种熟悉的方式，更多更便捷地访问后端。”\n\n针对这个消息，我们采访了 Deno 核心贡献者 justjavac（迷渡）老师，他表示：“这个社区早该成立了！这样可以让云计算或者边缘计算的平台提供和 Web 一致的 API，而不是各自开发自己的 API。对于社区开发者来说，不再需要额外学习一套 API，写一套代码就可以部署到不同平台。”\n\nWinterCG 社区成立的初衷是什么？\n\n据 Cloudflare 官方说明， WinterCG 社区组的本质在于为 JavaScript 运行时提供一个空间，以便于在 API 互操作性方面进行协作。这种协作大致包括三个方面，分别是：运行时之间的讨论；现有规范社区（WHATWG、W3C）中的 Web API 的提案，包括现有提案和新提案；完善和维护现有运行时行为的文档。\n\n对此，justjavac（迷渡） 认为，在 Node.js 发布的时候，还没有那么多的 Web API 规范，于是 Node.js 设计了一套服务器端 API，像 Deno 在设计之初就直接复用了 Web API，大部分 JavaScript 开发者都非常熟悉这些 API，比如 fetch、URL、TextEncoder 等。后来 WHATWG 制定了很多 Web API 规范，Node.js 的最近版本也开始添加了符合 WHATWG 规范的 API。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "物联网时代，智能产品的应用越来越广泛，然而想要构建一款满足合规要求的智能产品却并非易事。智能产品的构建通常涉及较长的产业链条，包括智能设备端、云设备端及用户操作端，而大多数从事 IoT 智能设备构建的开发者更多的经验集中在嵌入式设备的开发，对于在云平台上该如何轻松、安全地构建智能产品缺乏经验，且常常被一些设备端的问题所困扰。近日，亚马逊云科技 Tech Talk 特别邀请解决方案架构师郑辉作为嘉宾带来《使用 Amazon IoT Core 构建安全合规的智能产品》的主题分享。\n智能产品背后的挑战\n在构建智能产品时，开发者常常面临诸多挑战，包括安全合规挑战、大规模设备连接问题等。郑辉将开发者在构建智能产品时遇到的挑战概括为以下三点。\n\n首先，由于终端设备的多样化，物联网的开发和应用存在较严重的碎片化问题。传感器的种类多种多样，每个传感器对应的连接协议也包含多种通讯模块。此外，同一个设备也会对应不同的场景，如智能家居场景、安防场景、新能源场景等，这些场景所对应的终端不管是操作系统还是所使用的开发语言都大相径庭。因此，会导致严重的终端碎片化问题。\n\n其次，协议多样化也是困扰开发者的主要问题之一。对于物联网来说，最重要的是设备与设备的通讯。物联网技术框架体系中所使用到的通讯协议有：AMQP、JMS、REST、HTTP/HTTPS、COAP、DDS、MQTT 等。根据 Eclipse 基金会的调查，MQTT、HTTP、WebSocket 是物联网解决方案中最常用的消息传递协议。但整体来看，当前物联网协议呈现多元化发展，不同行业和场景适用不同的协议，在相同的场景下也可能有多个协议可供选择。\n\n第三，是数据隐私法规问题。世界各国都有相应的数据隐私法规，IoT 设备作为最接近用户端的设备，会收集到用户大量的数据，这些数据会涉及非常多的个人隐私。不管是美洲、欧洲还是亚太地区乃至各个国家，都有自己的隐私保护法。其中，最为著名的是欧盟的《通用数据保护条例》（GDPR）。目前，如何在构建智能产品时满足不同的安全合规需求，仍是企业和开发者面临的一大挑战。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "本文最初发表于 Treblle 网站，经原作者 Vedran Cindrić 授权，InfoQ 中文站翻译并分享。\n \n我在过去十年里，一直在研究的核心内容之一就是 API：从单一客户端使用的简单 API，到多种设备和多种用途的 API。在过去这些年来，我也有机会与很多第三方 API 一起工作，比如 Stripe、Twilio，以及其他一些不太流行但很有吸引力的 API。这些 API 几乎都以 REST 为基础，有些地方是独一无二的。\n \nREST 之所以流行，有许多理由可以解释。它易于理解、灵活、适用于各种规模，拥有庞大的社区，以及围绕其构建的各种工具。但是，除此之外，我还要说，许多流行的理由都是源于其最老的竞争对手——SOAP，它实在是太可怕了。如果你曾经使用过或与 SOAP 一起工作过，你就会明白我为什么这样说！它的客户端非常糟糕。客户端非常糟糕，人们可以随心所欲地使用 XML，它非常烦琐，有时候授权也非常奇怪……幸运的是，JSON 和 REST API 在这一战中获胜。\n \n另一方面，还有一些更新的、更现代的参与者，尝试着从基于 REST 的 API 中获得一些关注。当然，我指的是 GraphQL。GraphQL 也是以 JSON 为基础，共享了 REST 的优势，例如灵活性、性能、可扩展性等。对我个人来说，GraphQL 的两个主要缺点是它是由 Facebook 构建的，并且它把 API 设计过程转移到了客户端。我的意思是，这使得移动开发人员和前端开发人员有责任创建自己特别的 API，并且可以通过数据库进行查询。我不清楚你的想法，但是我觉得这个想法不是最好的主意。别误解我，我热爱移动和前端开发，但是他们在数据库设计、编写查询和构建 API 方面的知识上，也许并没有太多的经验。你也许不会要求你的后端开发人员设计一个应用，让汽车修理师修理飞机，或是请兽医为人类进行手术。他们能做到吗？或许，他们有可能。他们应该这么做吗？不，我不这么认为。\n \n依我看，REST 依然是丛林中的王者，不会轻易被打倒。REST 的唯一问题在于，归根结底，它既不是标准，也不是协议。相反，它是一套“架构约束”。这是一种不能称之为标准的花哨的方式，但是它却能激起很多人的想象力。他们往往会按照自己的想法去做，或按照自己的（错误）理解去实现这些约束。为了避免这样的误解，我决定把我所认为的 REST API 十条戒律都写下来。遵循这些戒律，你将会从你的移动开发人员那里得到关爱，从后端开发伙伴那里得到敬仰，在 Twitter 拥有摇滚巨星的地位。\n点击查看原文>",
