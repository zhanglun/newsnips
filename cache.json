Linux 作主力机，把虚拟机多开的这个需求分离出来，让 PVE 方案来做，当主力机需要用到虚拟机时，就 rdp 或 vnc 到 pve 里面的 windows 或 linux 。\n2. 只用来安装 windows 与 linux ，不需要安装 openwrt 、omv 、nas 等。初步想法是在 PVE 里面装一个 windows 7 （用作日常工作沟通、收发邮件、安装 windows 的一些软件比如 X 雷）、一个 windows server 2016 （学习与测试）、一个 ubuntu （学习与测试）、一个 linux mint （学习与测试）。\n3. 不考虑 mac ，已习惯 i3wm+mint ，主要是业界这些毒瘤软件不支持 Linux 让人烦。\n\n因为没做过相关实操，有几个问题想请教做过的老哥：\n1. 我也知道 pve 里面装 Linux 比较合适，但是需求就是要用 windows ，想问一下，在相同硬件情况下，pve 里面装 windows 虚拟机和普通的 vmware workstation 装 windows 虚拟机的方式，性能差别应该不大吧？如果相差很大，是为什么以及咋解决呢？\n2. 如果这套方案可行，我是想把 pve 放到公司 7*24 （主要在公司用电脑嘛，只走内网 RDP 也快，还能用公司电费），硬件体积最好小一些（也不用追求太极致，性能还是最主要的），pve 也是看了几天 youtube 视频才了解一点点（视频杂乱不成系统），硬件选配方面也不懂，我想问一下应该如何学习硬件选配和 pve 虚拟化（有网络基础和 Linux 基础），老哥们有比较推荐的播主或资源论坛吗。",

          "description": "自 1994 年面世以来，红帽 Linux 已经陪伴开发者们走过了将近 30 年的旅程。2014 年红帽吸纳了 CentOS 社区主要成员包括当时的项目领导者、核心项目贡献者。Red Hat 和 CentOS 项目联手，目的是开发用于企业 IT 的下一代 Linux 创新技术。这些年，我们看到开源模型继续蓬勃发展，推动了 Linux 容器、Kubernetes、微服务、无服务器等的兴起。鉴于社区推动的创新步伐迅速，社区领导层在 2019 年决定向 CentOS Linux 社区引入一个新模式：CentOS Stream，将社区工作转向上游。CentOS Stream 是一个面向开发者的发行版，旨在帮助社区成员、红帽合作伙伴和其他人在更稳定和可预测的 Linux 生态系统中充分利用开源创新。\n\n对最终用户影响最大的是 CentOS Linux 7 和 8 逐渐停止维护和更新。现有 CentOS Linux 操作系统用户如何应对？有哪些策略和实践经验可以借鉴？面对广大用户和开发者的普遍问题，亚马逊云科技 Tech Talk 特别邀请红帽高级解决方案架构师朱贺带来主题为《CentOS 操作系统停止维护后的对应方案与技术实践》的相关技术分享。\nCentOS 停更后，Linux 生态系统变化\n\n很多开发者无法理清 Linux 生态系统中各种版本之间的关系。那么我们首先做一个回顾，从 2014 年开始，红帽企业级 Linux 生态系统形成了 Fedora、RHEL 和 CentOS Linux 协同发展的局面。社区上游通过 Fedora 面向广大开发工程师提供桌面操作系统的持续创新和技术架构整合，大约每 6 个月发布一个版本；中游是红帽企业级 Linux，主要面向广大企业和应用开发商，特点是稳定、安全和性能优化，产品迭代和发展节奏有条不紊；下游就是社区领导的 CentOS Linux ，面向成本敏感用户和生态开发者。CentOS Linux 版本，产品迭代节奏紧跟 RHEL，用户在零成本获取的同时，一样可以享受到红帽 RHEL 的产品优势。\n\n\n\n7 年后， CentOS Linux 社区在 2021 年开始做出调整，逐步停更处于下游定位的 CentOS Linux 7、8 版本。CentOS 社区主要工作将转向 RHEL 上游，并开发维护新的 CentOS Linux 版本——CentOS Stream。\n点击查看原文>",
