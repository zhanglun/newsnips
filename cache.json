          "description": "zanx817: 如何计算贷款的月供或真实利率？\n一、问题\n在准备买房、卖车、做信用卡分期时，我们总是要预估每个月要多支出多少钱、交易的利率是不是太高了。但由于月供计算公式复杂，不利用 excel 等工具很难直接得出。而利率经过前期各种花式砍头息、”等本等息“等方式包装，实际的消费利率往往比宣传的高得多！高了多少？ 如何计算？金融机构都知道，但不会告诉消费者这个真相。而普通消费者，往往算不清。甚至又一些人用 excel 的内部收益率来计算利率，算的也没问题，但光填表就徒添了很多麻烦，也容易出错。\n二、利息是什么？\n首先介绍年化利率，（ annual percentage rate ，简称 APR)，指本金在一年后产生的利息占本金的比例就是年化利率。交易中通常用年利率表示一个贷款的“价格”，结算时，根据实际时长利用月利率、日利率对日、对月计算利息。其中月利率由 APR/12 算得。日利率由月利率除以 30 算得，即 APR/360 （注意不是 365 ）。所谓对日、对月计算，以 2 月 28 日到 3 月 29 日的贷款为例，2 月 28 日～ 3 月 28 日算一个月的月利，28 ～ 29 日再算 1 天的日利。这样就出现了用款不足 30 日但付息 31 日的情况。\n同时，分期费率不同于利率。分期费率往往是根据约定的比率乘以年限，然后均摊到每个月归还本金和费用。这样当还款过一半时，客户只欠金融机构一半的债，但仍然按照期初全额的债还款。实际上承担的利率非常接近费率的二倍。如果加上前期的担保金、砍头息等费用，实际成本远远机构宣传的二倍以上！营销人员往往宣传这种还款叫“等本等息”。但实际上，等额本息的特征就是每个月还款额相同，这种还款法依然是等额本息，但实际的利率却高了一倍！\n另外还有一种还款方式：等额本金。 其月供算法非常简单：月供本金=贷款总额 /贷款月数，月供利息=贷款总额*月利率。\n三、如何快速计算？\n可以使用 EXCEL 或者 Mac/iPhone 上的 Numbers 软件中的函数快速计算。可以利用 PMT(rate, nper,pv)公式计算月供，其中 rate 是利率，nper 是期数，pv 是贷款额。注意 rate 是 APR 时，nper 是年数（而不是月）。也可以利用 RATE(nper,pmt,pv)根据月供计算利率，其中 nper 为期数，pmt 为每期月供，pv 是贷款额。注意 pv 和 pmt 的符号必须是一正一负。上述公式可以这样记忆：pmt -> payment, nper -> n * period, pv -> present value 。 但记住了公式，也往往因为忘记换算利率和符号，导致算出的结果不正确。\n这里介绍我做一个微信小程序来计算：“真实费率计算器”，输入实际值就能得出结果，不需要考虑正负值、也不需要考虑换算，微信也几乎人人都有，非常易于使用。对比了多个银行合同，不管是根据月供算利率、还是根据利率算月供，都是真实无误的。这个小程序是纯粹的工具 app ，不收集任何的个人信息，请放心使用吧！ \n如果有一定量的用户的话，将来还可以增加期初付款、多种利率的图表对比等功能，欢迎反馈！",

PC 端（展开式）\n\n2. PC 端（弹出式）\n\n3. Mobile 端\n\n演示站点\n直接浏览 CabloyJS 的演示站点，增加更直观的感性认知\n体验 CabloyJS 应对大型项目的三驾马车：套件、模块、App 应用\n体验与众不同的pc=mobile+pad自适应布局风格，强烈推荐：分别用PC和Mobile单独体验演示站点。此言不虚，请您品鉴！！！\n演示站点：https://test.cabloy.com/\n演示站点的二维码：\n\n相关链接\n文档: https://cabloy.com/\nGitHub: https://github.com/zhennann/cabloy",
