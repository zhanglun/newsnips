          "description": "PumpkinPieM: \n最近在做一个 2D 游戏开发的小项目(c++)，有一段根据 event 类型执行相应动作的代码(如果有移动或类似动作则更新物体 Z 轴坐标)：\nswitch (event) {\n        case EntityEvent::Moving_Left:\n        case EntityEvent::Moving_Right:\n        case EntityEvent::Moving_Up:\n        case EntityEvent::Moving_Down:\n        case EntityEvent::Elevation_Change:\n        case EntityEvent::Spawned:\n            updateLayering();\n        default: break;\n    }\n\nEntityEvent 类型是 enum class 。我觉得这样的代码的一个问题是，如果我之后加入新的 EntityEvent ，然后我忘记在这段代码进行相应更改，那判断就会出问题。这样的代码越多维护难度就越大。\n我想的一个方案是将 EntityEvent 转变为 class ，然后加入一些 flag 。比如这个例子里我可以设定一个.modify_evelation,这样我的判断语句只要检查这个 flag 就行，不用进行枚举，也就不会有上面这个问题了。缺点就是放弃了 enum class 的轻便性。想知道有没有针对这种需求普适性的更好的解决方案呢？",

          "description": "近日，在Quora（类似知乎）网站上，有 Po 主提出了一个问题：“要使操作系统获得 UNIX 认证，需要做些什么？”答主 Terry Lambert 给出了非常精彩的回答，鉴于他的身份——前苹果工程师，曾负责 Mac OS X 内核的大部分工作，该回答很快就获得广泛关注并获得了上万赞。\n\n这是一个引人入胜的故事。早年苹果公司推出 Mac OS X 操作系统的时候，经常利用“兼容操作系统的 UNIX 内核”作为宣传手段。比如，在其网站上，就专门有一页介绍 Mac OS X 的 UNIX 的文章。\n\nThe Open Group（国际开放标准组织）对此提出了诉讼，称其未经授权便擅自使用Unix名称。一旦苹果败诉，就需要赔偿2亿美元。\n\n不过，苹果公司坚持自己可以自由使用Unix的名称，认为自己没有进行虚假宣传。但为了应付这场诉讼，据Lambert回忆，当时苹果对于此事主要有两个解决方案，要么以大约 10 亿美元的代价收购国际开放标准组织，要么赶紧获得 Unix 兼容认证，从而化解这场诉讼。\n\n史蒂夫·乔布斯将这个认证的“秘密”任务交到了前苹果技术负责人Lambert手上，需要针对现有的 Mac OS 源代码运行合规性测试，边测试边修改，完成时间只给了一年。这也意味着Lambert需要在短时间内对Mac OS X 内核的 1300 万行代码了如指掌，技术难度非常大。\n点击查看原文>",
