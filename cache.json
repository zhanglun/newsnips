          "description": "在4月27日举行的2022年华为全球分析师大会上，华为计算产品线营销副总裁张勤在演讲中表示，未来，算力的增量主要是AI算力的快速增长。未来10年，通用算力增长10倍、人工智能算力增长500倍。计算必然从通用计算走向通用计算+AI计算的多样性计算。\n\n当前，全国已有20多个城市在规划和建设人工智能计算中心。华为计算产品线营销副总裁张勤在上述大会上对InfoQ记者表示，人工智能会成为推动社会的引擎，旨在让AI算力像水和电一样成为城市公共基础资源，推动本地的产业、生态和人才的发展。这些建设中的人工智能计算中心，未来会连接成人工智能算力网络。通过人工智能算力网络，实现算力、数据、生态三大汇聚与共享，以此激活人工智能与各产业的共融共生。\n\n打造高质量的算力网络，已经逐渐成为各方共识。华为光传送领域总裁周军指出，算力网络将是未来10年的主旋律，企业不再满足于简单的“互联网+基础信息化”，而是希望将数字技术与核心业务有机融合，计算从“打辅助”，提升为主角。“企业使用澎湃算力来打造智能制造、柔性制造，大幅提升生产效率。这就要求网络从过去的‘尽力而为’的不确定发展为确定性保障的网络，我们提出品质算网方案，打造一张有路就通、毫秒时延、带宽灵活、智慧运营的全光算力网络，以确定性运力释放无限算力，实现‘算-网’深度融合。”\n\n面向多样性计算，华为聚焦硬件、基础软件等根技术的创新和研究，形成面向通用计算的鲲鹏计算产业和面向AI计算的昇腾计算产业。\n\n鲲鹏方面，华为目前通过主板开放已经发展了超过10家整机合作伙伴，去年整机伙伴发货占比已经超过80%。已有3500+伙伴、10000+解决方案通过鲲鹏兼容性测试认证。在基础软件领域，华为开源了欧拉操作系统、openGauss数据库，目前国内主流的操作系统和数据库厂家均已经推出基于openEuler、基于openGauss的商业发行版。鲲鹏计算产业，已经发展到80万+开发者的规模。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "容器相比虚拟机最突出的特点之一便是轻量化和快速启动。相比虚拟机动辄十几个G的镜像，容器镜像只包含应用以及应用所需的依赖库，所以可以做到几百M 甚至更少。但即便如此，几十秒的镜像拉取还是在所难免，如果镜像更大，则耗费时间更长。\n \n我们团队（阿里云弹性容器ECI）分析了 3000 个不同业务Pod 的启动时间，具体如下图。可以看出，在Pod 启动过程中，镜像拉取部分耗时最长。大部分 Pod 需要 30s 才能将镜像拉下来，这极大增加了容器的启动时间。\n\n如果是大规模启动，这个问题则会变得更糟糕。镜像仓库会因为镜像并发拉取导致带宽打满或者服务端压力过大而直接崩溃。\n \n我们多次遇到过这个问题。由于一个服务的副本数达到 1000+ ，在迅速扩容 1000+ 多个实例的时候，很多Pod 都处于Pending状态，等待镜像拉取。\n \n虽然 kubernetes 在调度的时候已经支持镜像的亲和性，但只针对老镜像，如果并发启动的新镜像的话，还是需要从镜像仓库里面拉取。下面提供几种常用的解决思路。\n点击查看原文>",
