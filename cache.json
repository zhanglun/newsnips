          "description": "2月7日，据外媒报道，陷入困境的日本科技巨头东芝计划拆分为两家公司，一家专注于基础设施，另一家专注于设备，以安抚对公司经营状况不甚满意的股东们。\n \n作为拟议计划的一部分，总部位于东京的东芝公司打算以约 1000 亿日元（约合55.2 亿人民币）的价格将其在空调部门东芝开利(Toshiba Carrier)的大部分股份出售给美国合作伙伴开利全球公司(Carrier Global Corp)。东芝周一表示，东芝还在出售东芝电梯和建筑系统公司（Toshiba Elevator and Building Systems Corp. ）以及东芝照明科技公司（Toshiba Lighting & Technology Corp.）。\n \n该提议仍需获得股东和监管机构的批准。东芝放弃了早先的三股拆分提案，因为早先的那版提案遭到了一些股东的反对。\n \n东芝曾经是日本最受尊敬的品牌之一，但自 2011 年 3 月福岛核灾难以来一直在苦苦挣扎。海啸导致三座反应堆熔毁，在一个仍然部分是禁区的地区喷出辐射。东芝参与了核能除役工作，这将需要耗费几十年的时间完成。\n \n不仅公司很大一部分精力搭在了核能除役工作上，公司近年来的声誉也因会计丑闻而受损。在公司官员多年来篡改会计账簿，设定了不切实际的盈利目标后，其首席执行官于 2015 年辞职以承担责任。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "构建一个通用的翻译系统，帮助每个人获取信息并更好地相互联系，是机器翻译（MT）领域的终极目标。但是，MT领域需要消除一些基本的限制，才能使这样的未来成为现实。\n\n\n本文最初发布于Facebook AI博客，由InfoQ中文站翻译并分享。\n\n现如今，大多数MT系统都使用多组双语模型。通常，这需要为每个语言对和任务提供大量的标签实例。遗憾的是，这种方法对于许多训练数据稀少的语言无效（例如冰岛语和豪萨语）。它的高复杂性也使得它无法扩展到Facebook的实际应用中，上面每天有数十亿人用数百种语言发帖。\n\n为了构建一个通用的翻译器，我们认为MT领域应该从双语模型转向多语言翻译——在这种情况下，一个模型可以同时翻译许多语言对，包括低资源（如冰岛语到英语）和高资源（如英语到德语）。多语言翻译是一种很有吸引力的方法——它更简单，更具可扩展性，而且更适合低资源语言。但直到现在，对于高资源语言对，这种方法的效果还比不上与专门为这些语言对训练的双语模型。因此，在许多语言中，提供高质量的翻译通常需要组合使用多个双语模型，而低资源语言被抛在了后面。\n\n现在，我们取得了令人激动的突破：单个多语言模型首次在14个语言对的10个中超过了专门训练的最好的双语模型，赢得了WMT这个著名的MT竞赛。我们的单一多语言模型为低资源语言和高资源语言都提供了最好的翻译，这表明多语言方法确实是MT的未来。\n点击查看原文>",
