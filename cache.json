          "description": "conge: \n本文最先出现在 https://conge.github.io/2022/06/09/eye/\n我在《 冥想的最佳环境》一文中提到，“我对冥想环境的要求只有一个：安全。”只有在安全的地方，人才能完全的放松，而无需警戒或紧张。\n在《简单冥想》中，我介绍了一个 5 分钟的冥想练习方法。同大部分的冥想练习一样，首先要求的就是练习者要闭上眼睛。而闭眼的前提也要求人你信任自己所处的环境的是安全的。\n安全，是一种心理感受，是主观的。有时候，并不完全受外界环境的影响。比如，就有人提问说，自己冥想前就不安，冥想过程中更甚，“冥想后觉得很慌很恐惧，看东西都觉得诡异，心里特别不安，这样要怎么办？”\n还有人问，冥想可以不闭眼睛么？\n今天，我就试着回答一下这两个问题。\n1. 冥想后莫名恐惧怎么办？\n先明确一点，并不是所有人都适合练习冥想，冥想也是有坏处的。如果要练习，先从简单的轻松的容易的短小的练习开始。如果确定自己不适合练习，那就停止。\n但恐惧的问题，值得探究一下。\n既然冥想之前就有不安，那显然，并不是冥想使你恐惧。而是恐惧影响你的冥想使其不能达到良好效果，实现冥想的目的。\n认识自己，是冥想最终达到的状态之一。\n很有可能，恐惧的出现，是你自己的内心在告诫你：你并没有准备好来认识你自己。\n当然，这是我的猜测。\n如果是我，我得先明确自己想要的，是怎样的生活。如果冥想是通向我的目的途径，即便有恐惧挡路，我也是要过去的。我会告诉我的恐惧说，你给我让路。\n在缺乏觉知力量的时候，可能无法认识自己的恐惧是什么，有怎样的来源。但，自己的恐惧，归根到底，是自己的。至少是自己可以影响的。\n我的经验告诉我，凡是从内心出生出的念头想法，都是意图想帮自己的。有时候它们会帮倒忙，但它们终究是想要帮你的。你的恐惧也是。\n它可能仅仅是要阻止你自己做一些可能伤害到自己的事儿。或者，它不希望改变现状，认为现状挺好，为什么要开始新的习惯，新得练习？\n你要学会倾听恐惧，跟它相处，搞清楚它要阻止做什么事儿，为什么。你要告诉它，冥想，你还是要练习的。你可以在恐惧可以承受的范围内开始，比如，只是 5 分钟。你会听它的预警，但也要它会听你的，去一点点的尝试新东西。\n这就是我如果面对这种情况，会怎样尝试，去面对自己的莫名恐惧。\n2. 冥想可以不闭眼睛么？\n可以的。\n若你是身处不那么安全的地方，睁眼可以消除帮助恐惧。若你身处如画的美景，壮丽的山巅，睁眼冥想可以使得你从自然的美丽旷达中收获更多。\n睁眼的冥想，我可以推荐两种：\n一，还是观呼吸，但眼睛选一处盯住，但又什么都不看。你能明白这是一种什么状态吗？就是注意力聚焦在呼吸上，而不聚焦于任何视觉物体上。这种情况下，虽然睁眼，视觉是处于觉察之外的。用一个词来描述，就是视而不见。视觉不聚焦于某物，担又保持对视野的觉察。注意力还是在呼吸之上。观察体会气息从鼻孔中有进有出。\n二，在视野范围内选一物，仔细观察它。这就要求你专注于视觉中的焦点之物。从组成它的部分到整体，小到纹理，大到轮廓，都仔仔细细观察，颜色明暗，色彩光泽，全身关注于它，还可以扩展到它与自己的关系，它能引起你怎样的情感。仿佛，这是你来到世界上后看到的第一件物品，也是这世界上唯一的物品……\n冥想修炼的是觉察。如能闭眼，会减少一路被感官可能的干扰，这是闭眼为好处。而睁眼仍可帮助我们确认环境的安全，驱除不必要的恐惧，同样可以通过专注来正心正念，止息冥想。\n结语\n恐惧，可能是你的心灵想要向你传达某种讯息，更需要你仔细的聆听。\n睁开眼睛冥想，可能会帮你克服一些因闭眼而产生的情绪。不妨试试睁眼的冥想，也许更适合你。\n你练习冥想时出现过恐惧或者其他的感觉吗？\n你尝试过睁眼的冥想吗？\n在评论里告诉我吧。\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto byAndrey Zvyagintsev on Unsplash\n\n\n\n我近期些的有关冥想的其他文章:\n2022-06-03 Fri. 冥想是有坏处的\n2022-05-17 Tue. 冥想的最佳环境\n2022-05-10 Tue. 冥想的根本\n2022-05-03 Tue. 冥想的时候浑身不得劲\n2022-04-27 Wed. 冥想，从练习坐姿开始 \n2022-04-22 Fri. 冥想与呼吸\n2022-04-15 Fri. 有关简单冥想练习的问答\n2022-04-08 Fri. 简单冥想\n2022-06-09 初稿",
