          "description": "我想，世上没有人会不知道“云”这个词。我指的并不是天空中的那些白色物体。问题在于，在技术领域，很少有人能真正理解这个词的真正含义。在本文中，我不会对这个领域进行更深入的探讨，而是将重点放在对云原生应用和传统企业应用的对比上。\n\n所以，在我们开始之前，我们要先了解一下这两种观念，以便我们能够更好地了解我们到底在比较什么。\n传统企业应用\n\n这种类型的应用是老式的单体应用。它们通常采用瀑布方法（或者是一些缓慢的 Scrum 尝试），并且与首次部署时所用到的软硬件密切联系在一起。它们对操作系统有着很大的依赖性，并且要求物理资源不易扩充，而且即使工程师在某些部分使用了微服务，它们也仍然是以单体应用的方式进行部署。这些应用的进一步开发往往会花费更多的时间和更多的成本。也会花费更多的时间在可扩展性上，并且无法根据“按需”来更改。在 10~20 年前，云服务几乎不存在的时候，它们的普及率是相当高的，但我们也要记得，那时候 IT 产业还很小，资金只集中在相当少的关键参与者。这个事实的重要性将在本文稍后加以论述。\n云原生应用\n\n这个术语描述了一种应用，它依赖于云计算的很多优势，并且建立在微服务架构之上。重要的是要记住，云原生开发的应用是一个描述它们如何创建、维护和优化的想法。这并不意味着这些数据会被存储到云端中，而是可以在本地存储，但是依然可以从云原生方式中获益。这对于监管非常严格的市场尤为重要。\n\n这些类型的应用程序也受益于 CI（持续集成）和 CD（持续部署）解决方案。\n\n更让我们感到困惑的是，还有一种基于云的应用的概念。它们通常是描述迁移到云端的传统企业应用。它仍然代表了其前辈的许多不足之处。在本文中，我们不会对此进行太多的讨论，但是我只想提及一下，以便你对此有一个全面的认识。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "近日，国家发展改革委、中央网信办、工业和信息化部、国家能源局联合印发通知，同意在京津冀、长三角、粤港澳大湾区、成渝、内蒙古、贵州、甘肃、宁夏等8地启动建设国家算力枢纽节点，并规划了10个国家数据中心集群。至此，全国一体化大数据中心体系完成总体布局设计，“东数西算”工程正式全面启动。\n\n“东数西算”起源于《全国一体化大数据中心协同创新体系算力枢纽实施方案》，由国家发展改革委、中央网信办、工业和信息化部、国家能源局联合印发，将重点解决西部算力需求不足，东部资源有限的核心问题。本次四部门联合通知，主要是在布局层面进行完善，通过以京津冀、长三角、粤港澳大湾区为代表的“东数”节点，以内蒙古、贵州、甘肃、宁夏为代表的“西算”节点，形成整体的“4+4”布局，初步计划到 2023 年底，使全国数据中心机架规模年均增速保持在20%左右，平均利用率力争提升到60%以上，总算力超过200 EFLOPS，高性能算力占比达到10%。国家枢纽节点算力规模占比超过70%。\n\n“东数西算”的思路、行动计划及关注重点\n\n“‘东数西算’中的‘数’，指的是数据，‘算’指的是算力，即对数据的处理能力。”国家发展改革委高技术司副司长孙伟介绍说，我国西部地区资源充裕，特别是可再生能源丰富，具备发展数据中心、承接东部算力需求的潜力。“要像‘南水北调’‘西电东送’一样，充分发挥我国体制机制优势，从全国角度一体化布局，优化资源配置，提升资源使用效率。”\n\n国家发改委指出，“东数西算”工程有三个总体思路：\n\n一是推动全国数据中心适度集聚、集约发展。通过在全国布局8个算力枢纽，引导大型、超大型数据中心向枢纽内集聚，形成数据中心集群；二是促进数据中心由东向西梯次布局、统筹发展；三是实现“东数西算”循序渐进、快速迭代。为坚决避免数据中心盲目发展，在当前起步阶段，8个算力枢纽内规划设立了10个数据中心集群，划定了物理边界，并明确了绿色节能、上架率等发展目标。\n\n围绕8个国家算力枢纽节点，10个国家数据中心集群分别是张家口集群、长三角生态绿色一体化发展示范区集群、芜湖集群、韶关集群、天府集群、重庆集群、贵安集群、和林格尔集群、庆阳集群、中卫集群。\n点击查看原文>",
