You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "MekoPan: 大晚上睡不着明天还要去加班，跟大伙吐吐苦水。毕业入职这行两年出头，工资不高不低。最开始是以 java 入行的，后来干过 golang 微服务，用 python 写过图形化界面跟需求脚本，目前在用 C++做基于传统 CV 的图像算法。一直没换过公司，刚入职的时候公司开动员会，我记得讲台上那个人大声的说要做“T”字型人才，现在看看自己一算是勉强有了，但是下面那一竖迟迟写不上去。说实话现在的图像算法干的很痛苦，因为我本身没接触过图像 CV，也不是干算法的料。上面给的算法目标在我看来有点虚无缥缈，又要泛化又要精度，每天疲于应付各种场景的指标调优。往往这个场景调好了，另一个又不行了。应该是我能力的问题。干的不顺就容易产生焦虑感，我挺享受用 python 写完脚本之后，期望的目标在代码的执行之下准确的反馈出来，现在的项目迟迟没有结果让我每天倍感烦躁。身边的人劝我赶紧跑了吧，我每次都是嘴上说着真 tm 不想干了但是依旧老老实实坐在工位上不断改进算法。写好的简历也没有投出几份，boss 上的联系每天都在刷新着手机屏幕，但我每次点亮手机后又缓缓扣下。一方面是感觉项目没做完就离职是不负责任的行为，但是自身能力的不足以及挫败感又时刻针扎着自己。另一方面我感觉这两年干的稀里糊涂，没有选择自己强的一方面深入强化，辗转于不同语言之间做着看似全面的发展以致于现在找工作都不知道要找那一方面。都说语言只是工具，思维才是最重要的。但是我觉得把一门语言练到得心应手或许才更加有利于未来的发展。说了这么多抱怨的话，因为在这里谁也不认识我。现实中不敢跟父母说，怕父母担心；跟朋友说朋友也不会真的设身处地体谅你，每个人都是一个个体，快乐可以相互传递，痛苦的东西就不要奢望他人帮你分担了。",

          "description": "Stoulla: \n先说结论，12.9 仅适用于看论文 /当画板 /做草稿纸。其他的都不如 11 寸。另外强烈建议省钱买 2020 款，2021 就是智商税。\n买多大\n先后试过 11 寸和 12.9 寸的 ipad pro 。最后因为看论文的硬需求留下了 12.9，11 寸看论文确实有些太过于小了，而且拿来做笔记也会写的很不自在。因此如果你真的是科研用途，还是强烈建议买 12.9 的。\n但是，12.9 寸有挺严重的问题是，太大了，而且网页没适配，经常性会切换成 mobile 模式，这样就会导致显示极其难看。而且碰见强制竖屏的应用，比如淘宝京东，那是真的看着恶心。压根等于用不了。另外看漫画会有，横屏两页有点小，竖屏又太大的问题。\n11 寸则不存在这种问题，而且 11 寸拿来打游戏和看网页真的很舒服，睡前放膝盖上看漫画，刷网站也是很棒。应用基本上也不会因为缩放问题太过于离谱。\n买什么\n11 寸的 ipad pro 2021 并没有 mini LED 。 但就我个人使用来说，和 12.9 寸的 mini LED 基本看不出特别大的差别， 即使是看视频，也没有宣传的那么大差距。这两个屏幕都还不错，况且如果买 ipad 并不需要在强光环境下使用的话，并不需要 mini LED 的那个高亮度。\n另外 M1 芯片，恕我直言，就 ipad OS 这个玩具 OS 来说，它上个火龙 888 都照样跑。根本不需要 M1 芯片，请不要被洗脑觉得自己需要 M1 芯片。所谓的宣传在 ipad 上剪视频和 p 图我也用了，无论是 Lightroom 还是 lumafusion，比起电脑上就是一玩具，干啥啥不行。所以所谓的生产力绝对不应该成为你选择 M1 的理由。\n唯一选择 M1 的理由是钱多了烧的， 大内存更是没必要，它就没这个应用可以用上。 因此我强烈不建议钱包紧的买 2021 款。\n关于钱\n请别只看这个本身多少钱，还得算上 Apple Care +， 手写笔， 以及保护套的钱。这一套你得再加上 2000+。 因此 IPad 如果不是刚需强烈不建议买 2021 款。因为加起来都快 1W 了。\n关于所谓的摄像头\n在国内，在某产品经理小而美的产品面前，所谓的那个摄像头居中那是完全的没有，因此你视频当然是，完全不如手机摄像头。所以想买个 iPad 晚上和女票一边视频一边摸鱼的可以歇了。\n关于做笔记\n有这样的硬伤哈，IPad / Mac 特有的笔记软件，GoodNote 一类对手写支持很好。但是问题在于它远不如 OneNote/Notion 等多平台支持。 要多平台支持的原因在于程序员做笔记总是需要复制代码的，而 IPad 上复制代码体验那肯定不如电脑。\n如果用 OneNote， 不支持压感，所以写出中文字来说巨丑，英文字倒是勉强能看。\nNotion 没键盘约等于用不了。屏幕键盘，特别难用。\n关于看论文\n看论文的话，因为它不方便导入的问题（别说什么你只需要开本地 FTP 传过去就好了之类的）， 不能直接在浏览器中插件直接点然后自动分类算个锤子的看论文，不连着找几篇参考论文同时看怕是在做高中阅读理解。而 IPad 的这个找论文然后导入体验巨差无比。可以说这个文件管理到目前为止仍然是一团 x 。\n另外，对论文体系的管理，同样因为这个奇怪的文件系统，以及大约残废的文献管理，所以仍然是不好用的。单单阅读一篇是不错的，但是要整理成体系，进行归类以及知识串联的话，IPad 不如 PC 远矣。\n写在最后\n作为生产力工具，IPad 是完全不合格的，至少我体验下来，它没有任何一个可以确实提升我生产力的功能。但是作为草稿纸，那是真的好草稿纸。IPad 其他功能现在已经完全被我放弃，作为草稿纸来用了。另外 IPad 手写确实挺流畅，所以如果你有手绘需求确实可以试试。\n写这么长是希望各位别被消费主义洗脑，就算买也请买 2020，2021 真的不太值，至少在我这里，我认为不值。",

          "description": "近年来，Deepfake图像做得越来越逼真了。在某些情况下，人类甚至没法轻易看出这些图像与真实图像之间的区别。尽管Deepfake图像的检测仍然是业界面对的一大挑战，但由于这项技术的水平越来越高，检测它的动机也越来越充分，例如：如果Deepfake图像不仅是为了娱乐和技术展示用途，而被用于大规模欺诈行为该怎么办？\n\n今天，我们与密歇根州立大学（MSU）合作，展示了一种检测和归因（attributing）Deepfake图像的研究方法，这种方法的基础是对单张AI生成图像的生成模型的逆向工程。我们的方法将推动真实世界环境中的Deepfake图像检测和跟踪研究，现实中Deepfake图像本身通常是检测器唯一能用到的信息。\n\n\n为什么要逆向工程？\n\n当前讨论Deepfake图像的方法侧重于判断图像是真实的还是Deepfake（检测），或识别图像是否由训练期间看到的模型生成（基于“封闭集”分类的图像归因）。但是，要想应对Deepfake图像激增的趋势，需要更进一步的研究，并设法将图像归因（image attribution）扩展到训练中存在的有限模型集之外。重点在于超越封闭的图像归因方法限制，因为Deepfake图像可能是用在训练中没见过的生成模型来创建的。\n \n逆向工程是解决Deepfake图像问题的另一种方式，但它在机器学习中并不是一个新概念。之前关于逆向工程ML模型的研究是通过检查其输入/输出对来获得模型的，这种方法将模型本身视为一个黑匣子。另一种方法假设硬件信息（例如CPU和内存使用情况）在模型推理期间是可用的。这两种方法都依赖关于模型本身的先验知识，这限制了它们在现实世界中的实用性，因为这些信息通常是不可用的。\n点击查看原文>",
