You cannot mix textual RSS feed or other video sources such as Vimeo.\nChanged: Default HTML template meta tag adjusted to match convention\nChanged: sources in template data is now ordered by last update timestamp (as opposed to alphabetical)\nThank you @PiyushLosalka",

          "description": "intellectual: \n有时候总是被一些问题困扰，比如家里地板上咋好多细小的杂毛？后来慢慢了解了户外，又了解了一点点面料知识。所以猜测是衣服上的短纤维掉落。之前无脑优衣库，结果发现罪魁祸首嫌疑最大的可能就是优衣库。之前一直就买纯棉的，因为觉得化纤衣服不好么，后来才知道化纤更多资料，打开了新世界。\n之前从知乎，值得买，8264 了解到类似大概这样的东西：\n防水：gtx event，看介绍说 event 会比 gtx 要透气一些，不过 event 似乎找不到商品，太少太少了，范儿 gtx 无敌了\n排汗：coolmax dri-fit climaCool airism 不过这些感觉咨询也都不透明，他们就自己吹自己，到现在也不知道那个好，消费者都在瞎子摸象\n保暖棉：p 棉 c 棉 知道一些，说 p 棉最顶级，c 棉差一些，别的 3M 新雪丽啥的都没看见在户外能立住脚\n还有抓绒的 p 绒 ，p 绒里面也是跟上面玩法一样三六九等，且每个等的差异巨大\n给人的感觉，似乎中文圈的户外知识断档了还是整体户外技术停滞了还是咋？\n特别不喜欢这种比如自己花大价钱买了个其实也就营销出来的东西，就想知道的多一点。现在夏天了，想买个吸湿排汗凉感透气的短袖啥的，真是越看越抓瞎。外加自己不想多花钱，像一开始就买最好的那种然后可以舒舒服服用好久。就更选择困难证了。\n比如这次想买排汗，似乎 coolmax 在各种地方显得最牛，然后有个叫 coolmax pro 的 coolmax extreme 是最高档。我想啊，这么高档的东西应该有识货的吧，结果淘宝一搜，一只手都数得出来...这样到底是这个东西 NB 到商家不敢用呢，还是智商税？反正很蹊跷。。。另外一直关注的某些户外品牌，之前还出 coolmax 的，近两年则出越来越少，换成自己家的保密名字的排汗，也不知道是靠堆料打响名气，然后减配开始圈钱，还是 coolmax 不行了。\n别的一些个人案例，比如最近两年买的 windstopper+800 蓬羽绒服，比之前前前后后买了 4 件的羽绒服都要好，当然也都更贵，其实一比，算是省钱了。后来 59 买的抓绒感觉也并不比 199 买的 p 绒差，就是这么玄。\n不知道 v2 有没有了解相关的户外大佬，介绍介绍，就算是国外的站，也可以带着翻译插件看看。",
