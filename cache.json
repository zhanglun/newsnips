          "description": "duforv2: \n看到很多 v 友真的是疯狂嘲讽 wolai ，但一点也不够了解关系的始末，参考 wolai 创始人的帖子:\n而自从 Notion “借鉴” Airtable 推出表格之后，我觉得作为一个信息组织与协同的工具，我理想中的模样已经基本成型了。而我也成为 Notion 在国内极少数付费接近 10000 美金的用户之一，让部门内的几十个下属都在 Notion 上沟通与协作。工作方式变革之彻底，在行业来说都是罕见的。\n在我最推崇 Notion 的那段日子里，我几乎安利给了身边所有的好友，甚至在去年给王兴都安利了一把。\n因为我觉得，这样类型的软件让我依稀看到了未来的模样。我所说的未来，不是具体某一个软件的形态，而是我一直在思考的信息组织方式的未来和人们协同进行工作的未来。\n但人往往还是得屈从于现实，国内的网络环境，一旦遇到网站无法访问的情况，好几次让整个团队的工作整体陷入停滞，而让所有人都科学上网也不是一个具有可操作性的事情。再加上 Notion 对中国用户的极不友好与傲慢、对于严重 Bug 的不闻不问不改、对于任何问题都只给你 add a vote 的敷衍、5000 万美元融资后竟然随意阉割已付费用户权益的严重商业道德缺失都让我非常非常失望甚至愤怒，在我看来作为一个 10,000 美金付费用户连基本的尊重都没有得到。\n当我们发布了链接样式的第二天，Notion 也更新了多年来没有更新过的链接样式（下划线终于不再与东亚方块文字粘连），和我们相似到几乎无差，我不会说这是 Notion 抄袭我们，而是大家最终都考虑到了同样的问题，那就是一切都必须是“形式美”的。\n同时，我们也要解决所有的不完美。访问速度和稳定性首当其冲。我们前期花了大量时间在设计基础架构上，以至于我们现在应对 100 万甚至 1000 万用户都可以轻松自如探囊取物。同时我们解决了国外同类软件的很多 bug ，在体验上是更上一层楼的。我们迭代的速度非常快，别人花两年才做好行内公式，而我们从无到有只花了四天，wolai 的内测微信群都不敢相信我们有如此高的效率以及如此少的睡眠。这，都是为了做出更好的产品。\n本来 Notion 创始人就对中文支持很差，很不尊重汉语用户，逆向歧视原生民族。做他们的精神资本家图啥？\nNotion 本来就是提出一种新的信息组织形式，Box 展示了用户级的网盘组织形式，其他公司都别开发了？而且马上微软也要发 Loop ，很多软骨头这时候却欢呼雀跃了。",
