          "description": "随着移动互联网和云计算技术的迅猛发展，越来越多的数据在云环境下进行存储、共享和计算，云环境下的数据安全与隐私保护也逐渐成为学术界以及工业界关注的热点问题。目前阶段，隐私保护技术主要基于密码算法及协议（如安全多方计算、同态加密等）完成场景落地，其优点主要在于具有较高的安全性和可靠性，然而，由于这些算法或协议的实现依赖于大量复杂计算（如乘法循环群上的乘法、指数运算，Pairing运算，格上的数学运算等），因此存在较大的性能瓶颈，难以在实际场景中大规模应用。\n\n作为基于密码学的隐私保护技术的一种替代方案，可信执行环境（Trusted execution environment，TEE）基于硬件安全的CPU实现了基于内存隔离的安全计算，可在保证计算效率的前提下完成隐私保护的计算。\n\n本文将阐释梳理TEE的概念定义及发展脉络，剖析TEE与基于密码学的隐私保护技术的对比及其在联邦学习中的应用，最后介绍TEE的现有框架和相关应用。\nTEE定义与发展脉络\n概念及辨析：TEE与REE\n\nTEE是一种具有运算和储存功能，能提供安全性和完整性保护的独立处理环境。其基本思想是：在硬件中为敏感数据单独分配一块隔离的内存，所有敏感数据的计算均在这块内存中进行，并且除了经过授权的接口外，硬件中的其他部分不能访问这块隔离的内存中的信息。以此来实现敏感数据的隐私计算。\n\n富执行环境(Rich Execution Environment，REE)指的是操作系统运行时的环境中，可以运行如Android、IOS等通用的OS（Opreating System）。REE是一个容易受到攻击的开放环境，如敏感数据的窃取、移动支付盗用等等。而TEE是中央处理器上的一个安全区域，能够保证敏感数据在隔离和可信的环境内被处理，从而免受来自REE中的软件攻击。此外，与其他的安全执行环境相比，TEE可以端到端地保护TA(Trusted Application)的完整性和机密性，能够提供更强的处理能力和更大的内存空间。在下图这一典型的可信执行环境架构中，TEE内部为REE中的软件提供了接口，使得REE中的软件可以调用TEE对数据进行处理，但不会泄露敏感数据。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "Jamon Holmgren是一家软件开发公司的创始人兼CTO，拥有超过25年的编程经验，同时也是React Native的核心成员，维护着几个开源库。在这篇文章里，他试着尽可能公平地从多方面去讨论Flutter和React Native的优劣势。本文仅代表他个人观点，希望能为读者带来收获。\n\n\n作为目前人气最高的多平台移动应用框架，Flutter与React Native可谓难分伯仲。关于二者谁更胜一筹的争议也从未止歇……开发者纷纷站队，应用交付也只选其一。那么，到底谁更强？\n\n取巧的回答是，“具体要分情况。二者各有利弊，选谁不选谁、要看具体取舍。”\n\n但这样的回答说了等于没说。废话文学解决不了问题，正面对线才是群众们喜闻乐见的场面。所以，咱们就整点直接的、刺激的，聊聊Flutter和React Native谁更强。\n这话题，重要吗？\n其实不重要，但不重要不代表没意思：性能、开发者体验、Dart与JavaScript、本机集成、标准库等等都是很有意思的话题，都值得拿来一聊。\n\n有些朋友可能觉得这篇文章有点标题党，别着急，我会在后文中以更细微的方式深入探讨论断背后的种种细节。\n点击查看原文>",
