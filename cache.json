          "description": "( 戳此报名>>> 后疫情时代企业数字人才发展圆桌π ）\n\n与以往的金融危机和经济危机不同，新冠肺炎疫情给企业带来的冲击和考验是前所未有的。在这场危机中有的企业就此倒下，而有的企业则凭借数字化能力逆势而上。随着十四五规划中对数字经济政策的大力推动，企业数字化转型已经成为共识。\n\n目前，已经转型成功或者拥有一定数字基础的企业，呈现几何倍数的成长趋势。不少企业，在疫情期间，在创始人的带领下，开启CEO带货直播，迅速调整其经营模式，产品销量大幅增长。拥有数字化能力逐渐成为今天企业一个重要的分水岭。\n\n但根据IDC的调查和企业数字化转型评估成熟度模型显示，我国大多数企业数字化能力比较薄弱，企业数字化转型并不深入，仍然停留在转型的初始阶段。数据显示，55%的国内企业处于“数字化入门者”的阶段，新技术运用还在实验阶段，客户体验不佳；30%的企业处于数字化探索者的阶段；而只有不到1%的企业走到了企业数字化转型的最后一个阶段，成为数字化颠覆者。\n\n大部分企业之所以处在数字化转型的初始阶段，其主要原因一方面在于数字人才的匮乏，另外一方面在于企业管理者思维的守旧。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "近期，Couchbase 对全球拥有 1000 名或更多员工组织的 650 名 IT 领导者进行了年度调查，最终发现受到疫情等因素的影响，企业在失败的数字化转型项目上平均浪费了 412 万美元，在这种背景下，架构师们表示压力很大，60% 的受访者表示在数字转型项目上花费的太多时间都浪费在处理遗留技术上了，也有企业在转型过程中因为过分依赖外包而失败。\n\n企业在失败的数字化转型项目上平均浪费了 412 万美元\n\n根据报告，企业进行数字化转型主要是受到了内外部压力的驱动，外部压力可能来自于竞争对手或者疫情等，内部压力主要来自于业务部门的想法（占比 24%），高管的施压（24%）以及开发人员的压力，如果这一趋势继续持续下去，我们可能会看到数字化转型更多受到内部战略的推动，而不是外部影响。\n\n然而，转型过程依旧十分艰难。2021 年，82% 的企业无法开展数字化转型项目，80% 的企业出现项目失败、延期或缩减的情况。虽然其中一些问题可能是由于疫情加剧的外部因素造成的，但许多问题是由于对遗留技术的依赖，或由于访问或管理相关数据的问题造成的。\n\n这些问题往往是方法和战略问题，56% 的受访者表示，对疫情的即时反应本身并没有给他们如何处理 IT 带来一些经验，但从更长远的角度来看，90% 的企业已经改变了数字化转型的预算方式，这有望使许多企业摆脱资源短缺的局面。95% 的受访者已经发现了在 2019 年底无法实现数字化转型的原因。在这些组织中，46% 正在向云过渡，42% 正在替换传统技术和流程。\n点击查看原文>",
