          "description": "卷首语：开源未来发展的三个未解问题\n作者：蔡芳芳\n无论你是否从事开源相关工作，在过去一年里应该都能感知到开源极高的关注度和讨论热度。\n从全球范围来看，过去一年，开源整体呈现高速发展的趋势，越来越成为跨越国界和语言的共识。据最新官方报告，2021 年 GitHub 活跃用户数和活跃代码仓库数量均有明显增长，其中新增活跃用户数超过 1600 万、新增活跃代码仓库数量超过 6100 万。 在 Github 活跃用户分布上，北美用户仍然占据最大比重（31.5%），亚洲次之（31.2%），但两者在活跃用户数量上已经非常接近。\n开源正逐渐从“开发者亚文化”变成一个主流的软件开发模式，而 2021 年会是这个转变过程中相当关键的一年。这在中国体现得更加明显，云计算的高速增长、中美贸易战带来的断供风险，都极大地促进了国内对于开源领域的投入。\n整体而言，开源正朝着积极的方向发展，但同时仍有一些问题摆在从业者面前，期望能在不久的将来得到解答。\n疑问 1：中国本土开源基金会是否会形成新的发展模式？\n\n2020 年 6 月，开放原子开源基金会（OpenAtom Foundation）官宣成立，中国终于有了首个本土的开源基金会。2021 年，华为欧拉、阿里龙蜥、OpenCloudOS 等国产自主可控的操作系统相继捐赠或宣布将捐赠给开放原子开源基金会。\n与国外几大主流基金会相比，开放原子开源基金会有其特殊性。不管 Linux 基金会、OpenStack 基金会还是 Apache 软件基金会，都是围绕着一个大型的平台级的核心项目，聚集相关的开发者、厂商、用户，在这个背景之下成立基金会，然后基于这个核心项目的技术路线去孵化更多新技术、新项目。通常新项目都会跟基金会核心项目有关联，由于已经有核心生态的开发者围绕在基金会周围，所以新技术加入后可以孵化得更快。\n点击查看原文>",

          "description": "Java不适合编写桌面应用，这是事实还是偏见？\n\n本文作者以个人视角对Java桌面发展历程做了回顾，内容来自他在上世纪九十年代后期担任Java开发者时的所见所感，主要讲述曾经的“杀手级”桌面语言Java是为何从21世纪开始颓势尽显、步入衰落的。值得一提的是，作者如今在做一款开发者友好型Java桌面部署工具（jDeploy），其实他还是希望Java可以重拾风采，再度变得对桌面开发具有吸引力。\n\n\n我的大学时代正好赶上2000年之前的最后那几年，当时Java是计算科学专业里的官方语言。虽然也有几门课程要求使用C和C++，但所有基础知识教学都是围绕Java语言来设计的。为了防止有读者朋友较真，我再说得更准确些：这些课程会用Java语言来教学，不是说只教Java。\n\n其实大学的计算机科学课并不教授特定的编程语言，教学内容主要是相关概念，再使用时下流行的编程语言来演示这些概念，所以学生们得拿出课余时间掌握编程语言。也有些课程要求更严格，比如“这份作业必须使用Java完成”，但大多数高级课程就不再做此限制，大家想用什么语言就用什么语言。（有些作业需要使用特定的库或者编程语言。我还记得有一份作业就是用pthreads库为操作系统分配线程，相当于强制使用C语言。）\n\n我上大学那会，对Java的认知还仅限于Applet。我既不清楚Java在行业里是什么地位，也不知道它跟其他编程语言相比到底有什么优势。而且越是深入学习，我就越觉得Java这东西有点名不副实——它更像是种玩具语言，毕竟那些“真正”的严肃开发都是用C++这类语言实现的。反正系里总有一帮故作深沉、头发胡子一大把的家伙，总爱吹嘘跟C++一比、Java屁都不是。\nJava很慢\n他们倒也不是胡搅蛮缠，最常见的理由就是“Java很慢”。相信任何用过Java GUI应用程序或者包含Java Applet网页的朋友都同意这个观点。那时候用Java编写的桌面应用程序就只有开发工具，我能想起的就是ArgoUML和NetBeans，它们确实不好用而且速度很慢。那种慢，就像是双脚陷进了泥潭——无论是上下滚动还是打开菜单，所有操作都有“粘粘”的延迟。\n点击查看原文>",
