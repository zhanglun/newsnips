          "description": "Added: experimental support for iTunes podcast feed: Demo | Source. With this new release, you can render an audio control to play the mp3 file and display iTunes episode duration. It is \"experimental\" due to these caveats:\n\nThis feature is currently only available through custom template.\niTunes has no strict format requirement for duration. The unit is most likely seconds but can be \"hh:mm:ss\" or \"mm:ss\" for some sources. A future version may expose a human readable string to the template.\nNo image support yet. Some shows might have disabled CORS or use a relative URL for image, which forces osmosfeed to download the image during build. A future version may support it.\nYou can't republish the podcast in the feed output. Supporting this goes beyond the scope of the project at the moment.\nFixed: the articles in template data were not sorted.\nThank you @Zenigata",

          "description": "引言\n在从单体应用向微服务架构转型的过程中，服务配置管理从只需要应对一个单体服务，变为应对大量分布式服务，难度呈几何级增加。为了解决这个难题，各种应对分布式服务的配置中心应运而生，如何搭建一个高效合理的配置中心已经成为每个大型分布式系统必经的考验。而在服务“上云”的大趋势下，如何让配置中心在云平台顺利落地，更进一步，如何借助云计算的优势让配置中心如虎添翼，目前业内对这一块还处于探索阶段。本文将介绍FreeWheel核心业务系统在AWS云平台上搭建配置中心的实战，作为搭建云原生配置中心的参考，希望能给大家带来启发。\n\n\n更多相关内容参见系列文章：云原生环境下的微服务实践全解\n\n为什么需要配置中心？\n分布式系统兴起之后，配置管理变得尤为复杂。1984年，业界就有两位学者Kramer Jeff和Magee Jeff在IEEE发表了一篇文章《分布式系统的动态配置》，其中阐述到：\n\n\n动态系统配置是在系统运行时对其进行修改和扩展的能力。在大型分布式系统中，这是一个必不可缺的功能，因为如果需要停止整个系统来对其部分硬件或软件进行修改，在生产环境是难以接受的，或者会产生较大经济损失。另外，动态配置也有助于系统在生产环境上组件的增量集成，以达成系统演进的目的。\n\n\n这篇文章指出了动态配置对于分布式系统的重要性，即在系统运行时，如何经济安全地对系统进行调整。现在分布式系统已经发展到了从前难以想象的复杂程度，除了动态配置，配置管理还面临更多挑战，例如：\n点击查看原文>",
