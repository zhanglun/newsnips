          "description": "在过去几年里，蚂蚁集团的基础设施进行了广受瞩目的大规模 Mesh 化改造，成为业内服务网格化的一个标杆，在收获了基础架构团队掌握数据平面带来业务敏捷性的同时，也享受到了将基础设施 SDK 从应用中剥离出来后带来的应用和基础设施双方更高的易维护性。然而服务网格并不是银弹，大规模落地后也面临着新的问题。\n\n适逢其时，微软牵头的 Dapr 横空出世，把分布式应用运行时的概念带入了大众视野，我们也尝试使用这种思路来解决 Mesh 化后遗留的问题，本文通过回顾蚂蚁集团一路从微服务架构到 Service Mesh 再到分布式应用运行时的整个演进历程，结合生产落地过程中遇到的各种问题及思考，尝试探讨一下未来五年，云原生运行时可能的发展方向。\n1.从 Service Mesh 到应用运行时\n\n2018 年，蚂蚁集团在 Service Mesh 刚刚开始流行的时候就在这个方向上大力投入，如今已三年有余，SeviceMesh 早已在公司内大规模落地，支持了生产环境数十万容器的日常运行，2019 年下半年，Dapr 项目正式开源并持续火爆，应用运行时的概念引起了人们的关注，蚂蚁集团也踏上了从 Service Mesh 到应用运行时的演进道路。\n蚂蚁 Service Mesh 实践的收获与遗留问题\n\n在传统的微服务架构下，基础架构团队一般会为应用提供一个封装了各种服务治理能力的 SDK，这种做法虽然保障了应用的正常运行，但缺点也非常明显，每次基础架构团队迭代一个新功能都需要业务方参与升级才能使用，而遇到 bugfix 版本，往往需要强推业务方升级，这里面的痛苦程度基础架构团队的每一个成员都深有体会。\n点击查看原文>",
