          "description": "Apache Airflow 是一个能够开发、调度和监控工作流的编排平台。在 Shopify，我们已经在生产中运行了两年多的 Airflow，用于各种工作流，包括数据提取、机器学习模型训练、Apache Iceberg 表维护和 DBT 驱动的数据建模。在撰写本文时，我们正通过 Celery 执行器和 MySQL 8 在 Kubernetes 上来运行 Airflow 2.2。\n\n\n\nShopify 在 Airflow 上的应用规模在过去两年中急剧扩大。在我们最大的应用场景中，我们使用了 10000 多个 DAG，代表了大量不同的工作负载。在这个场景中，平均有 400 多项任务正在进行，并且每天的运行次数超过 14 万次。由于 Shopify 的内部采用率越来越高，我们的 Airflow 部署将会产生更多的负载。因为这样的迅速增长，我们所面临的困难包括：文件存取速度太慢、对 DAG（Directed acyclic graph，有向无环图）能力的控制不足、流量水平的不规则、工作负载之间的资源争用等等。\n\n接下来，我们将与大家分享我们所获得的经验以及我们为实现大规模运行 Airflow 而构建的解决方案。\n使用云端存储时，文件存取速度可能会变慢\n对于 Airflow 环境的性能和完整性，快速的文件存取速度至关重要。一个清晰的文件存取策略可以保证调度器能够迅速地对 DAG 文件进行处理，并且让你的作业保持更新。\n点击查看原文>",
