          "description": "从消费互联网爆发，到产业互联网崛起，全球数据量呈现暴增态势。《多样性算力技术愿景白皮书》指出，行业应用的多样性带来数据和算力的多样性，没有一种计算架构可以高效满足所有业务诉求。计算密集型应用需要计算平台执行逻辑复杂的调度任务，而数据密集型应用则需要高效率地完成海量数据并发处理，这使得单一计算平台难以适应业务要求，计算多样性成为必然。\n\n在多样性计算的构建中，存在着一些不太明了的问题，例如，为什么多样性计算需要共建？企业加入开源社区是共建的好途径吗？加入开源社区如何决策？未来，多样性计算会有怎样的发展趋势……\n\n4 月 15 日，openEuler Developer Day 2022 大会上，欧拉开源社区副理事长武延军、华为基础软件生态专家邱磊、Intel 开源技术中心总监杨继国、北京开源芯片研究院副院长唐丹、超聚变操作系统产品总监谢留华、以及新华三集团操作系统开发部部长焦旭坡，围绕主题《如何构建多样性计算架构的 OS》进行探讨，共同解答多样性计算共建中企业和开发者面临的这些困惑。\n共建，是实现多样性计算融合的唯一出路\n\n据公开资料显示，2004 年全球数据总量近 30EB，到 2020 年，该数字达到 35000EB，相当于每 18 个月翻一倍。万物互联的智能时代呈几何式增长的数据，对算力需求的增速已经远超摩尔定律。人类面临着空前的数据量和计算压力，对算力需求也变得更加多样化。\n\n以往，依靠芯片工艺来提升算力的方式，已经无法满足多样性计算的需求。当前，更需要计算体系的架构创新，来缩短算力发展与技术发展之间的距离，如通用计算走向通用计算加异构计算的架构创新；从硬件到基础软件，再到应用使能的全栈协同创新。在探索贴近行业的全场景协同、安全可信方面持续创新的方向上，目前，在基础软件行业内存在的一个共识是：单打独斗满足不了日益增长的算力需求，多样性计算的整合，只有依赖用户、厂商、开发者与社区的多方共建。\n点击查看原文>",
