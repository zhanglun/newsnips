          "description": "美国当地时间 5 月 7 日，有消息称苹果机器学习总监 Ian Goodfellow 宣布辞职，离开了加入三年的苹果公司，而后 Goodfellow 在一封发给员工的电子邮件中确认这一消息。虽然并不清楚 Goodfellow 的主要离职原因，但他在邮件中提到了自己对复工计划的一些不满看法。\n苹果复工计划引发员工不满\n \n根据此前公布的复工计划，苹果要求员工从 4 月 11 日起回到办公室工作。起初，员工每周只需返回办公室工作一天，其余时间远程办公。随着时间的慢慢推移，苹果逐渐增加了办公室工作的时间，截止 5 月 2 日，苹果要求员工每周回办公室工作两天，而在 5 月 23 日之后每周至少要在办公室工作三天。\n \n苹果的这项复工计划引发不少员工的不满情绪。此前，一份匿名社交网络 Blind 对苹果员工复工情况进行的调查报告显示，有 56% 的员工已经开始寻找其他工作。在 Blind 收到的答复中，有员工说他们不愿意进入办公室工作，还有一部分员工认为回到办公室工作可能会感染新冠病毒，办公室文化会影响办公效率，而且这样很难维持工作和生活的平衡状态（WLB-Work-life Balance）。\n \nGoodfellow 也有类似的看法，他在邮件中提到：“我坚信，更大的灵活性对我的团队来说才是好的政策”。\n点击查看原文>",
