          "description": "小米上市以来最大规模员工激励：向4931位员工授予约1.749亿股小米股票；滴滴为造车高薪招人，北京、深圳高级经理年薪50万元起；苹果公司发生广泛宕机事件；芯片新突破，清华制成世界上栅极长度最小晶体管；黑客组织宣称入侵了微软，拿到Bing和Cortana等数百个项目的源代码....\n\n资讯\n京东被传大比例裁员，涉及京喜、京东国际等多业务部门，3月31日为离职deadline\n近日，京东被曝裁员的消息在社交媒体上引起热议。据花儿街财经报道，京东内部高层人士透露，目前裁员确已启动，涉及京东零售、京东国际、京喜等多个业务部门，其中社区团购业务“京喜拼拼”波及最广，裁员比例达到10—15%。目前HR在约谈各个业务部门负责人，并给出明确的裁员比例，要求各负责人尽快“动手”终止与下属员工的劳动合同，2022年3月31日为此轮离职的deadline。\n\n网传京东“裁员比例高达50%”，多个业务部门负责人表示这为不实消息。比如20个人的部门，裁员人数为4人，比例差不多在20%左右。赔偿比例初步设定为N+1。多年经验且不愿具名的的京东集团HR人士向《花儿街财经》透露，实际上，京东每年都有优化计划（裁员计划）。只不过今年裁员比例高了些，和大环境有关。\n滴滴为造车高薪招人，北京、深圳高级经理年薪50万元起\n据第一财经报道，滴滴正在为造车招兵买马。某整车厂研发人员刘生在接受采访时表示，他近日接到一份为滴滴造车物色相关人才的猎头邀约。“岗位工资大概是50~80万，如果面试结果好，能够给高一级的定级，薪资更高，还有期权。”根据猎头提供给刘生的职位要求描述，刘生所适配的岗位为研发高级经理，工作地点为北京或者深圳。“实际上Title给得更高，收入也是有提升的。”刘生说。从猎头给予刘生的职位描述来看，该岗位为产品研发定义，并且猎头直言是滴滴造车。刘生认为，滴滴已经开始独立建立研发体系，并在北京、深圳两地布局研发团队。\n\n滴滴已经入局自动驾驶领域。2021年4月，滴滴在上海车主发布硬件平台——滴滴双子星，该平台搭载于沃尔沃XC90冗余车型后，可在核心高性能传感器、车载自动驾驶系统、远程协助系统和前装量产车型深度兼容四个方面实现多层冗余，成为滴滴新一代自动驾驶车队的主力配置。\n点击查看原文>",
